Having read 'Out of the Ether' by Matthew Leising (great book btw for anyone looking to learn about the origins of Ethereum) I found myself considering the DAO attack and whether there was a theft and a crime committed?

I guess this is more of a philosophical question as yes obviously everyone who sent Eth to the DAO was essentially entrusting their money and I don't condone someone taking millions of dollars from average people; however entrusting it to a smart contract which anyone could view the source code to is different to say entrusting it to an ordinary bank.

If everyone could view the source code and hence it's vulnerabilities then surely the responsibility is on the sender to know what they're sending their money to (granted you'd have to be a computer genius but still) then no crime has been committed because the laws of the contract are there in black and white.

It's a bit like sending your money to a bank whom you trust, but in their small print terms and conditions it says actually anyone might take your money for their own purposes and theres nothing we can do about it. Obviously no one would use a bank like that, and if your money was stolen you wouldn't say a crime has been committed as the bank stated that it might happen.

I'm interested to hear people's thoughts as well as the legalities of what actually went down!

Per the data published by multi-crypto data platform Tokenview, a total of 101,232 ETH worth $344.29 million were added to the Ethereum 2.0 staking contract in nearly a week (whoa!).  


Following the addition of 101,232 Ethereum to the cryptocurrency’s 2.0 staking contract, the address now holds a whopping 10,823,650 ETH valued at $36.81 billion. It is worth noting that the landmark figure was recorded barely 15 months after the Ethereum 2.0 staking initiative was launched. Despite Ethereums’ contribution to the staking contract being inaccessible until the official launch of the 2.0 upgrade, contributors have continued to deposit large volumes of ETH. The reason for this commitment is large because stakers who make deposits to the staking contract will earn 4.81% in annual rewards.   


The contract was launched as part of an effort to transition ETH from a PoW mechanism to a PoS algorithm. ETH developers opted for the PoS algorithm over the PoW because the latter is associated with slower and more expensive transactions, with fees soaring above $250 per transaction on certain occasions. From my personal experience using KAIBA DeFi I would say that their application of the PoR consensus has proven to be a very good solution, so maybe it could be helpful here as well.

User activity on ETH has seen slow growth due to ETH’s high gas fees, not surprising, right? I noticed that plenty of users prefer to use Solana and Avalanche as gas fees on all of these chains cost less than a dollar. ETH has less throughput also in comparison to other Layer 1 blockchains.   
 

Various scaling solutions can help in boosting the growth of ETH's ecosystem. But what I've heard is that the rollups have shown the most potential as a scaling solution out of all of these. They can solve significant problems for ETH users, which are high gas fees and less throughput.   
 

I've noticed over time how rollups are enabling transactions at a low cost and have a high throughput capacity without compromising the security as settlement of all the transactions executed on rollups happens on ETH. ETH can act as a settlement layer of the ETH ecosystem while rollups are used as an execution layer.   
 

You know how processing is sluggish, optimistic rollups can boost scalability by up to 10-100x, depending on the transaction. With the advent of shard chains, this figure will rise even further, as more data will be available if a transaction is challenged. The two most widely used optimistic rollups are Optimism and Metis, which allows us to provide extraordinarily quick transactions that take only a few seconds and cost only a few cents while yet preserving ETH Layer 1 security.

I feel like Ethereum has it's own incredible ecosystem and has bought us a ton of incredible ecosystems on other chains such as my Polygon example.

Very curious to hear what the Ethereum crowd has to say and feels about all this. Thank you in advance for your input.",0.7189632058143616,0.2133695652173913,0.5152173913043478,0.134,0.044,0.822,0.9699

I can get from that that both NFT buyers and NFT sellers end up benefiting by doing business on Andromeda.

This is nothing new for Music. Let me give a example:

let's say you buy a limited edition signed vinyl. it comes with a front row ticket to the show, a meet n greet, and a tshirt. you go to the signing...you get to meet the artist and get your collectible vinyl! it's great, even to say a few words to this artist. you really enjoy their music, you just want to say thank you.

its a great experience. you carefully take it home your signed collectible vinyl and make sure its in perfect condition.

the show sold out, now the ticket that came with the vinyl is worth $200!

You sell it to someone from work because you can't make it. It's an hour away anyway. You're glad you could make it to the signing tho.

***Now its 10 years later.*** Your concert days are more limited now, but you still love the music. You find that old tshirt, still in perfect condition in the back of your closet. Its worth $250 on StockX. Wow!

Next, you think about your prized vinyl. Signed and still in mint condition. You see that the signed collectible vinyl is worth $1000 on eBay. Wow! You think to yourself about how funny that is. You listen to the music on Spotify or watch on Youtube every once in a while. For the most part, the vinyl has been gathering dust in your collection. But thats okay, it's like an old trophy to you. Maybe you'll frame it one day. You decide to hang on to it. You love having it, and plus if its worth $1000 now...imagine another 10 years later?

Did any part of this have to do with owning this music?

## Wat merge?

A lot more info can be found on [ethmerge.com](https://ethmerge.com/) so I will keep this section light

* When the merge happens, Ethereum will be secured by Proof of Stake instead of Proof of Work.

* It's called ""merge"" because it's about *merging* the Beacon Chain (*consensus layer*) with the current chain (*execution layer*) and ditching the proof of work part of the execution layer.

* The Merge is not ""ETH 2.0"", there is no ETH 2.0, it's an obsolete term.

* If you don't know, ""consensus"" is just a fancy word for the goal of ordering transactions and getting some economic guarantee that this order won't change. Both PoW and PoS achieve consensus by different means:

  * PoW: ""It costs too much to mess up with the order of blocks, playing by the rules is more lucrative.""

  * PoS: ""It costs too much to mess up with the order of blocks, because if I do I'll lose all the money I put up as collateral.""

## Why merge?

* Lower security costs since there's less energy needed to achieve consensus.

  * For PoW you need miners to be able to *at least* cover all the hardware and energy they use otherwise no one will mine. This requires a big issuance that is quickly sold for fiat to pay the bills.
  
  * For PoS you just need to give some yield to stakers to make people want to deposit capital rather than just invest it elsewhere. No big bills to pay beyond an ordinary computer and an internet connection, so the yield just has to reflect the opportunity costs and risks involved.

* More sustainability:

  * The security of a blockchain is basically proportional to the value of its coin. This is true for both PoW (more valuable coin rewards = more reasons to play by the rules = more miners = harder to mess up the consensus) and PoS (more valuable staked coins = more reasons to play by the rules to avoid losing the staked coins)

  * A newly issued coin is essentially value being taken from all holders of the coin and being redistributed to someone. All else equal, selling that coin for fiat extracts value out of the network 

* It opens the door for many scaling solutions in the future, namely data sharding, statelessness, light clients, and [more](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1466411377107558402)

* It helps reduce some complexity of the code going forward, by separating concerns between execution and consensus.

* Appeasing the environment and gamers is certainly a nice side-effect, but not really a major goal behind the switch to PoS, since it's mostly about external negativities over which Ethereum as a protocol doesn't have much control (source of energy production, GPU supply chains, etc.)

## Wen merge?

* **There is no official date announced yet**. Just cautiously optimistic devs and community hoping for mid-June [for various reasons](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethstaker/comments/tbql1n/five_indicators_that_the_ethereum_merge_will/)

* Testing is still ongoing, the merge will not be shipped until developpers are fully confident that nothing will go wrong.

* I personally don't set my hopes up for June, but I definitely expect it over the summer, with the asterisk of ""unless something went extremely wrong during testing"" (e.g. a critical bug requiring weeks to fix, possible exploit in the specification itself require months of fixing and reimplementing)

* The difficulty bomb is set to go off in June, so there **will** be a hard-fork around that time, with or without the merge.

* I suggest bookmarking [wenmerge.com](https://wenmerge.com/) for a quick view of the latest estimates for each testnet merge that will lead up to mainnet merge, as they are announced.

## Nope, your a idiot. They will delay it like they always have in the past. They promised it years ago and still haven't delivered.

* Some useless sementics first: there is no official date announced yet, and there never was. Can't have a delay on a deadline that never existed in the first place

* The quotes along the lines of ""Ethereum will switch to proof of stake by 2018"" came from a place of extreme optimism and of underestimating the complexity of not only a secure PoS design, but also a safe transition from PoW to PoS. A lot is different today. None of these applied back then, but they do today:

  * There is a full protocol specification written that went through years of research, analysis of possible attack vectors and refinements

  * Client implementations are all done, it's all about testing now

  * It's all hands on deck on the merge, there is literally no other work being done other than the merge. All the necessary steps to lead to the merge are done. It's not even ""they're done implementing complex stuff like EIP1559, so more attention can now be focused on the merge"", it's: ""**all** the attention is focused on the merge"". There is no possible world where the merge ""gets delayed again"" and the devs start working on other stuff on the side. Until the merge is done, nothing else gets done. 

  * **PoS is literally running as we speak** in the form of the [Beacon Chain](https://beaconcha.in/) since December 2020. That's over a year of Ethereum's PoS getting battle tested in production (to a degree) with currently over 10 million ETH on the line. It just isn't producing blocks for the PoW chain yet.

## Those millions of ETH staked will crash the price the very moment they're unlocked LOL

For sure, there will be plenty of stakers who will want to finally take profit, especially those who locked their ETH back when 32 ETH was worth $10k. But there's plenty more to consider on the other side of the equation:

* The merge doesn't unlock any ETH. Withdrawals will come in the first hard fork following the merge, likely 6-8 months after. That's months of no proof of work issuance (~13k ETH/day) being sold off *and* no proof of stake issuance coming into circulation.

* Just like how there's a queue to deposit ETH, there will be a queue to withdraw it.

  * First, when you exit you have to [wait a little over 9 days](https://github.com/ethereum/annotated-spec/blob/master/phase0/beacon-chain.md#how-does-eth2-proof-of-stake-work) before even joining the queue.

  * Then you're in the queue. Assuming a mass sell-off event, everyone is in that queue, limited at a rate of 1125 per day. So there's no ""opening the floodgates"" moment. Everyone unstaking would literally take over a year. A year of ~38k ETH entering back into circulation (or... roughly 1% of average daily volume)

* After the merge, validators will start receiving fee rewards as well, doubling the yield [by some estimates](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vrK5sY5ooq-F8dcyRhmmAJ5YtgkvWKWP3OfGCZIYxSA/edit#gid=0). There are thousands of people waiting in line to stake *right now*. They're okay with a 5% yield on their ETH, I don't think they're gonna yeet the moment it becomes 10% lol

* The biggest risk involved in staking is *by far* the merge. Something catastrophic could go wrong, yet people have been staking and locking up their ETH for over a year despite this risk and despite the ETH being locked until an unknown floating date. How many people/institutions are waiting on the sidelines for this risk to disappear before jumping in?

* And don't forget stakers exiting means fewer validators which means higher rewards for the stakers who don't exit. It also means more incentives for other people to *start* staking if they weren't before...

* But of course it's crypto, and crypto's gonna crypto. The merge will bring excitement and volatility and possibly a sell-the-news dip, who knows. I don't pretend to know the future, but the way I see it it's much more likely way more ETH will flow *into* staking than out of it.

## If proof of stake is so good, then how come Ethereum didn't go with that from the start?

* Proof of Work is easy to conceptualize and implement, Proof of Stake isn't. Especially when back in 2014 it was mostly a theoretical concept still being researched, with some blockchain implementing some version of it.

* There were several fundamental problems with PoS that needed to be overcome from a research perspective before thinking about implementing it. 

* There is no one-size-fits-all for Proof of Stake. Every PoS blockchain comes with its own PoS specification that has pros and cons on various aspects, so it's not as simple as ""but this other blockchain did it, why can't ethereum just do the same thing""

* Starting as a proof of work chain had the benefit of letting anyone mine coins on their own without anyone's permission, which helped the coin distribution become way better than those newer chains that are proof of stake from the start and have to decide how to allocate the initial coins, which can't really be done permissionlessly.

* Related to above: Yes, there was still a premine/presale for Ethereum, but it has now been diluted to half the supply after years of mining and multiple bull/bear cycles making that ETH swap hands, bringing the distribution [closer to Bitcoin's](https://medium.com/@adamscochran/the-10k-audit-42c100dd32bb). So it's not that big of a deal in 2022 when Ether as an asset is extremely liquid and easy to acquire. 

## Nah, this is really just a ploy to screw over the miners one last time after years of hard work

* PoS has been the eventual goal since [day 1](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/07/22/launching-the-ether-sale/), everyone mining was always aware that it would end one day. There is no rugpull or unfairness going on here.

* Economic factors trump any kind of miner-blockchain loyalty. You can kinda view the blockchain as a business and the miners as employees:

  * Miners/employees have been paid for the service they provide (namely, secure consensus) with the block rewards. The paycheck is an expense for the employer and it comes from diluting the value of existing coins from holders (see above in ""why merge?"")

  * Miners go to the chain offering the highest rewards, most of them would ditch Ethereum in a heartbeat if another GPU minable coin gave out more rewards

  * Similarly, Ethereum will pay less for the service it requires if stakers can do it for way cheaper. 

* It's not entirely exclusive. Miners can also be holders of the coin, and users of the blockchain. Nothing prevents them from holding their rewards and becoming stakers too.

## The coin stops having inherent value if you're not spending real world energy to mine it

I don't really buy this argument. There is nothing magical about computing hashes over and over until you land on one that fits arbitrary requirements. I mean, you could have a proof of work blockchain where the work is done by solving sudoku puzzles and it would work exactly the same: NP-complete problem, hard to compute one way but easy to verify a solution once one has been found. That doesn't mean solving sudoku inherently brings value into the world. Cranking up the mining difficulty of a coin doesn't magically make everyone richer, it just makes mining less profitable – unless of course demand goes up too, which so far hasn't been too much of a problem in crypto

The way I see it, the value of a coin ultimately comes from supply and demand, and the demand comes from how valuable the blockspace is. People need ETH to buy the blockspace, regardless of whether that ETH is generated by a miner or a staker. Sure, the more miners there are the higher the security/decentralization which further increases the value proposition of the blockspace in a positive feedback loop, but [feedback loops exist in Proof of Stake Ethereum too](https://i.imgur.com/3bPV35a.png) and they're super cool too!

## Proof of Stake is a recipe for total centralization

* It's basically the same as Proof of Work but slightly different. ""Better"" or ""worse"" really depends on your opinion. The way I see it, PoW is really just PoS with extra steps.

* Ethereum as a community values decentralization highly, any potential centralization vector is addressed by the research team to come up with ways to mitigate it, even if it's at the cost of other important stuff like scaling (e.g. keeping gas limits low so more nodes can participate in decentralization, even if that results in congestion and high fees)

* There **are** shortcomings currently, decentralization is a spectrum and a process and we're not there yet, and for the time being there are many centralization crutches that need to go away on the long term. That said, none of these crutches represent existential risks for the network, and for practically any ""it's centralized because X"" statement, there is an item on [the roadmap](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1466411377107558402) addressing X. I personally find it much more fascinating to come up with a whole bunch of stuff to solve X rather than give up and say ""it can't be done because of X"". 

* Something interesting about Ethereum's PoS design that is often overlooked: Quadratic penalties. A single validator going down, messing up, or downright attacking the network doesn't get penalized very badly. A thousand validators doing it at the same time get penalized much more heavily. 

  * This means that if you're a megawhale with thousands of validators, it's in your own best interest to spread them out, avoid cloud hosting, use different clients, etc. sure, the capital is still concentrated, but at least the points of failures are distributed which is good for the health of the network.

  * Compared to a big mining operation that relies on a central location to amortize costs, which can be spotted from energy usage and shut down if the authorities don't like it. It's hard to move mining equipment across the world, but staking only relies on private/public keys and not any actual hardware beyond a consumer grade computer.

## PoS is really just ""who has money makes more money""

* Yes. Unfortunately we live in a world of high wealth inequality. Blockchains don't fix that. 

* It's also true of proof of work: Whoever has money can buy more mining rigs and make more money. Except with mining, the ROI becomes better with economies of scale: Centralized mining operations have the big bucks to get bulk/discount rates on hardware and move to the places with cheap electricity. The solo miner simply can't realistically compete. With Proof of Stake, everyone earns the same yield proportionally, where they stake $10 or $10M.

* ""*Centralized or not, those big mining operations have no reason to attack the network and weaken it since they dumped millions in infrastructure*""....... so you're saying you're fine with such big actors having some kind of a big *stake* in the network?

## Passive interest on your deposit though? Printing money out of thin air? That's literally central banks and fiat part 2 electric boogaloo

* You have to really stretch it to make this case, but I've seen people do that lol. Those takes usually begin with ""proof of stake is nothing new""

* There's still ""work"" being done by validators: creating blocks and validating other blocks. It's just that the work done is composed entirely of the *actually useful work*, instead of computing hashes over and over again until one of them meets an arbitrary requirement. 

* It's not really ""free money being printed out of thin air"", there are still costs involved in staking capital, they're just more abstract and less direct than energy bills:

  * Opportunity costs – Why stake at all if another investment offers you a better yield?

  * Illiquidity – From the moment you deposit, your capital is locked up, queued up until your validator is active, then when you withdraw there is yet another queue before getting it back.

  * Inherent risks – It's still a fairly new thing, something could go wrong, there could be a critical bug, network could get attacked, your staking hardware could get compromised, etc.

  * Volatility – at the end of the day it's still a volatile asset, if you're the kind of investor who denominates their investments in their country's fiat currency, then a 5% yield on an asset that can drop 30% overnight isn't all that great (the upside of 5% yield on an asset that doubles is pretty great though, turn that 100% gain into 110%)

  * Maintenance – You still have to maintain and secure your validator, ensure 100% uptime, update software, etc. 

* Here's where it gets nifty: The more stakers there are, the lower the individual rewards get. This basically means that all those costs above will get priced by the market itself. It's easy to see why: If the staking yield is too low, then the rewards don't justify the costs and people will pull out and invest elsewhere, bringing the yield back up. Likewise if it's too high, that'll attract more capital and bring it back down. 

* For example, let's say the market as a whole decides that 5% is the ideal yield, of which 3% comes from issuance. That works out to about 30 million ETH staked printing 900 thousand new ETH per year. At a total supply of 120 million ETH, that's an inflation rate of 0.75%. Which is outpaced by EIP1559 burn as long as gas fees are at least 23 gwei. (I cannot stress this enough: *Ether-the-asset will become a yield-bearing deflationary asset very soon*)

* ""*Nice math but there's no supply cap + they change the monetary policy all the time*"" 

  * The goal has been ""minimum viable issuance to secure the network"" for years, priorizing network security over an arbitrary supply cap.
  
  * No update to the monetary policy has ever increased supply inflation. Low inflation rate (specifically *dis*inflation) has been the goal since day 1.

  * There will be an equilibrium acting as an effective supply cap – decided again by market forces valuing Ethereum's blockspace – once the rate of EIP1559 burn matches the rate of issuance. That's super nifty if you ask me.

* So yeah, there's no ""central Ethereum bank"" adjusting rates arbitrarily and printing money to cronies.

## Whales have all the money needed to take over and change the rules and slash honest stakers

* No. Ethereum has no on-chain governance of any kind for this reason. Protocol updates are a community effort (*Layer 0*) and you don't need any money staked to call out bad ideas and participate in the process.

* This is exactly the same as Proof of Work: Even if you have 99% of the hashpower, you can't make invalid transactions that steal people's money without their private keys, or change protocol rules, or really do anything beyond reorganizing blocks. The 1% of honest nodes will reject any block that don't follow the rules and you'll be mining on an invalid/useless chain. Now replace hashpower/mining with stake/staking and the same holds true for Proof of Stake (with the difference that someone caught reorganizing blocks will have their entire stake destroyed, whereas the blockchain can't exactly destroy mining rigs)

* And simply put, there is a fuckton of ETH involved. 10 million and counting and that's *before the merge*. At current prices that's roughly 30 billion dollars. Both ""amount of ETH staked"" and ""value of ETH"" are projected to go up, so attacks become increasingly unlikely due to the sheer economic cost involved in doing an attack — *once* — and the absurdity of acquiring that much ETH in the first place if the attack comes from an outside actor (where would you buy 10 million ETH to have 51% of the stake? 20M?)

## 32 ETH is way too much, the average person doesn't have that much

* The reason for such a high number is it has to fall in a technical sweetspot. In a nutshell, it has to be low enough to be accessible and have enough validators to secure the chain, but high enough to not have too many validators and bloat the chain with overhead. And having a fixed amount for each validator reduces some complexity by having each validator weighted exactly the same in the randomness process.

* There is a whole bunch of [math involved](https://thomasborgers.medium.com/ethereum-2-0-economic-review-1fc4a9b8c2d9) to arrive at 32 ETH from a technical standpoint, back when 32 ETH was worth about 7000 USD. [Earlier math from 2017](https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/parametrizing-casper-the-decentralization-finality-time-overhead-tradeoff-3f2011672735) even suggested over 1000 ETH minimum. 

* However I do agree it's a lot. There are some ideas of how it could be lowered ([better signature aggregation](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/rwojtk/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_7_07_january/hrmt6o0/) or [a rotating cap of active validators](https://ethresear.ch/t/simplified-active-validator-cap-and-rotation-proposal/9022)) but they don't seem to be very high on the priority list currently.

* Thankfully, just like mining pools exist, there are staking pools to allow staking in smaller amounts. It doesn't necessarily fly in the face of the ""not your keys not your coins"" mantra, thanks to things like [RocketPool](https://rocketpool.net/), [Secret Shared Validators](https://medium.com/coinmonks/secret-shared-validators-on-ethereum-2-0-ea29ab380016) (not yet launched) which use smart contracts to be permissionless, decentralized and non-custodian. And because of the quadratic penalties mentioned above, I believe decentralized staking operations will outperform the centralized ones on the long run. I recommend superphiz's [guide to staking](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethstaker/comments/t1xpr5/how_to_stake_on_ethereum_march_2022_edition/) for more info. And obviously, I admit staking through exchanges is yucky if you value decentralization

## PoS hasn't been proven, while we know PoW works

That's actually totally fair and there is no real rebuttal to this, obviously. Only time will tell. I just think it's irrelevant in the context that Ethereum *is* switching to PoS and was always going to. If you don't believe in it, don't participate/invest in it. I do personally believe in a long term sustainable PoS Ethereum, but even then I'm glad good ol' boring-by-design Bitcoin will be there chugging its proof of work along.

It's all part of the great crypto experiment of our lifetime. Either it's just a fad and will fail into obscurity, which would be a bummer for sure, or we'll have succeeded in creating monster robust networks capable of outlasting humanity. To achieve that, prioritizing decentralization is key. Which is something I mainly just see in Bitcoin and Ethereum, despite the widely different philosophies. It's why I'm glad to have both to truly see what's what on the long term.

That's over a year of Ethereum's PoS getting battle tested in production (to a degree) with currently over 10 million ETH on the line. It just isn't producing blocks for the PoW chain yet.

## Those millions of ETH staked will crash the price the very moment they're unlocked LOL

For sure, there will be plenty of stakers who will want to finally take profit, especially those who locked their ETH back when 32 ETH was worth $10k. But there's plenty more to consider on the other side of the equation:

* The merge doesn't unlock any ETH. Withdrawals will come in the first hard fork following the merge, likely 6-8 months after. That's months of no proof of work issuance (~13k ETH/day) being sold off *and* no proof of stake issuance coming into circulation.

* Just like how there's a queue to deposit ETH, there will be a queue to withdraw it.

  * First, when you exit you have to [wait a little over 9 days](https://github.com/ethereum/annotated-spec/blob/master/phase0/beacon-chain.md#how-does-eth2-proof-of-stake-work) before even joining the queue.

  * Then you're in the queue. Assuming a mass sell-off event, everyone is in that queue, limited at a rate of 1125 per day. So there's no ""opening the floodgates"" moment. Everyone unstaking would literally take over a year. A year of ~38k ETH entering back into circulation (or... roughly 1% of average daily volume)

* After the merge, validators will start receiving fee rewards as well, doubling the yield [by some estimates](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vrK5sY5ooq-F8dcyRhmmAJ5YtgkvWKWP3OfGCZIYxSA/edit#gid=0). There are thousands of people waiting in line to stake *right now*. They're okay with a 5% yield on their ETH, I don't think they're gonna yeet the moment it becomes 10% lol

* The biggest risk involved in staking is *by far* the merge. Something catastrophic could go wrong, yet people have been staking and locking up their ETH for over a year despite this risk and despite the ETH being locked until an unknown floating date. How many people/institutions are waiting on the sidelines for this risk to disappear before jumping in?

* And don't forget stakers exiting means fewer validators which means higher rewards for the stakers who don't exit. It also means more incentives for other people to *start* staking if they weren't before...

* But of course it's crypto, and crypto's gonna crypto. The merge will bring excitement and volatility and possibly a sell-the-news dip, who knows. I don't pretend to know the future, but the way I see it it's much more likely way more ETH will flow *into* staking than out of it.

## If proof of stake is so good, then how come Ethereum didn't go with that from the start?

* Proof of Work is easy to conceptualize and implement, Proof of Stake isn't. Especially when back in 2014 it was mostly a theoretical concept still being researched, with some blockchain implementing some version of it.

* There were several fundamental problems with PoS that needed to be overcome from a research perspective before thinking about implementing it. 

* There is no one-size-fits-all for Proof of Stake. Every PoS blockchain comes with its own PoS specification that has pros and cons on various aspects, so it's not as simple as ""but this other blockchain did it, why can't ethereum just do the same thing""

* Starting as a proof of work chain had the benefit of letting anyone mine coins on their own without anyone's permission, which helped the coin distribution become way better than those newer chains that are proof of stake from the start and have to decide how to allocate the initial coins, which can't really be done permissionlessly.

* Related to above: Yes, there was still a premine/presale for Ethereum, but it has now been diluted to half the supply after years of mining and multiple bull/bear cycles making that ETH swap hands, bringing the distribution [closer to Bitcoin's](https://medium.com/@adamscochran/the-10k-audit-42c100dd32bb). So it's not that big of a deal in 2022 when Ether as an asset is extremely liquid and easy to acquire. 

## Nah, this is really just a ploy to screw over the miners one last time after years of hard work

* PoS has been the eventual goal since [day 1](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/07/22/launching-the-ether-sale/), everyone mining was always aware that it would end one day. There is no rugpull or unfairness going on here.

* Economic factors trump any kind of miner-blockchain loyalty. You can kinda view the blockchain as a business and the miners as employees:

  * Miners/employees have been paid for the service they provide (namely, secure consensus) with the block rewards. The paycheck is an expense for the employer and it comes from diluting the value of existing coins from holders (see above in ""why merge?"")

  * Miners go to the chain offering the highest rewards, most of them would ditch Ethereum in a heartbeat if another GPU minable coin gave out more rewards

  * Similarly, Ethereum will pay less for the service it requires if stakers can do it for way cheaper. 

* It's not entirely exclusive. Miners can also be holders of the coin, and users of the blockchain. Nothing prevents them from holding their rewards and becoming stakers too.

## The coin stops having inherent value if you're not spending real world energy to mine it

I don't really buy this argument. There is nothing magical about computing hashes over and over until you land on one that fits arbitrary requirements. I mean, you could have a proof of work blockchain where the work is done by solving sudoku puzzles and it would work exactly the same: NP-complete problem, hard to compute one way but easy to verify a solution once one has been found. That doesn't mean solving sudoku inherently brings value into the world. Cranking up the mining difficulty of a coin doesn't magically make everyone richer, it just makes mining less profitable – unless of course demand goes up too, which so far hasn't been too much of a problem in crypto

The way I see it, the value of a coin ultimately comes from supply and demand, and the demand comes from how valuable the blockspace is. People need ETH to buy the blockspace, regardless of whether that ETH is generated by a miner or a staker. Sure, the more miners there are the higher the security/decentralization which further increases the value proposition of the blockspace in a positive feedback loop, but [feedback loops exist in Proof of Stake Ethereum too](https://i.imgur.com/3bPV35a.png) and they're super cool too!

## Proof of Stake is a recipe for total centralization

* It's basically the same as Proof of Work but slightly different. ""Better"" or ""worse"" really depends on your opinion. The way I see it, PoW is really just PoS with extra steps.

* Ethereum as a community values decentralization highly, any potential centralization vector is addressed by the research team to come up with ways to mitigate it, even if it's at the cost of other important stuff like scaling (e.g. keeping gas limits low so more nodes can participate in decentralization, even if that results in congestion and high fees)

* There **are** shortcomings currently, decentralization is a spectrum and a process and we're not there yet, and for the time being there are many centralization crutches that need to go away on the long term. That said, none of these crutches represent existential risks for the network, and for practically any ""it's centralized because X"" statement, there is an item on [the roadmap](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1466411377107558402) addressing X. I personally find it much more fascinating to come up with a whole bunch of stuff to solve X rather than give up and say ""it can't be done because of X"". 

* Something interesting about Ethereum's PoS design that is often overlooked: Quadratic penalties. A single validator going down, messing up, or downright attacking the network doesn't get penalized very badly. A thousand validators doing it at the same time get penalized much more heavily. 

  * This means that if you're a megawhale with thousands of validators, it's in your own best interest to spread them out, avoid cloud hosting, use different clients, etc. sure, the capital is still concentrated, but at least the points of failures are distributed which is good for the health of the network.

  * Compared to a big mining operation that relies on a central location to amortize costs, which can be spotted from energy usage and shut down if the authorities don't like it. It's hard to move mining equipment across the world, but staking only relies on private/public keys and not any actual hardware beyond a consumer grade computer.

## PoS is really just ""who has money makes more money""

* Yes. Unfortunately we live in a world of high wealth inequality. Blockchains don't fix that. 

* It's also true of proof of work: Whoever has money can buy more mining rigs and make more money. Except with mining, the ROI becomes better with economies of scale: Centralized mining operations have the big bucks to get bulk/discount rates on hardware and move to the places with cheap electricity. The solo miner simply can't realistically compete. With Proof of Stake, everyone earns the same yield proportionally, where they stake $10 or $10M.

* ""*Centralized or not, those big mining operations have no reason to attack the network and weaken it since they dumped millions in infrastructure*""....... so you're saying you're fine with such big actors having some kind of a big *stake* in the network?

## Passive interest on your deposit though? Printing money out of thin air? That's literally central banks and fiat part 2 electric boogaloo

* You have to really stretch it to make this case, but I've seen people do that lol. Those takes usually begin with ""proof of stake is nothing new""

* There's still ""work"" being done by validators: creating blocks and validating other blocks. It's just that the work done is composed entirely of the *actually useful work*, instead of computing hashes over and over again until one of them meets an arbitrary requirement. 

* It's not really ""free money being printed out of thin air"", there are still costs involved in staking capital, they're just more abstract and less direct than energy bills:

  * Opportunity costs – Why stake at all if another investment offers you a better yield?

  * Illiquidity – From the moment you deposit, your capital is locked up, queued up until your validator is active, then when you withdraw there is yet another queue before getting it back.

  * Inherent risks – It's still a fairly new thing, something could go wrong, there could be a critical bug, network could get attacked, your staking hardware could get compromised, etc.

  * Volatility – at the end of the day it's still a volatile asset, if you're the kind of investor who denominates their investments in their country's fiat currency, then a 5% yield on an asset that can drop 30% overnight isn't all that great (the upside of 5% yield on an asset that doubles is pretty great though, turn that 100% gain into 110%)

  * Maintenance – You still have to maintain and secure your validator, ensure 100% uptime, update software, etc. 

* Here's where it gets nifty: The more stakers there are, the lower the individual rewards get. This basically means that all those costs above will get priced by the market itself. It's easy to see why: If the staking yield is too low, then the rewards don't justify the costs and people will pull out and invest elsewhere, bringing the yield back up. Likewise if it's too high, that'll attract more capital and bring it back down. 

* For example, let's say the market as a whole decides that 5% is the ideal yield, of which 3% comes from issuance. That works out to about 30 million ETH staked printing 900 thousand new ETH per year. At a total supply of 120 million ETH, that's an inflation rate of 0.75%. Which is outpaced by EIP1559 burn as long as gas fees are at least 23 gwei. (I cannot stress this enough: *Ether-the-asset will become a yield-bearing deflationary asset very soon*)

* ""*Nice math but there's no supply cap + they change the monetary policy all the time*"" 

  * The goal has been ""minimum viable issuance to secure the network"" for years, priorizing network security over an arbitrary supply cap.
  
  * No update to the monetary policy has ever increased supply inflation. Low inflation rate (specifically *dis*inflation) has been the goal since day 1.

  * There will be an equilibrium acting as an effective supply cap – decided again by market forces valuing Ethereum's blockspace – once the rate of EIP1559 burn matches the rate of issuance. That's super nifty if you ask me.

* So yeah, there's no ""central Ethereum bank"" adjusting rates arbitrarily and printing money to cronies.

## Whales have all the money needed to take over and change the rules and slash honest stakers

* No. Ethereum has no on-chain governance of any kind for this reason. Protocol updates are a community effort (*Layer 0*) and you don't need any money staked to call out bad ideas and participate in the process.

* This is exactly the same as Proof of Work: Even if you have 99% of the hashpower, you can't make invalid transactions that steal people's money without their private keys, or change protocol rules, or really do anything beyond reorganizing blocks. The 1% of honest nodes will reject any block that don't follow the rules and you'll be mining on an invalid/useless chain. Now replace hashpower/mining with stake/staking and the same holds true for Proof of Stake (with the difference that someone caught reorganizing blocks will have their entire stake destroyed, whereas the blockchain can't exactly destroy mining rigs)

* And simply put, there is a fuckton of ETH involved. 10 million and counting and that's *before the merge*. At current prices that's roughly 30 billion dollars. Both ""amount of ETH staked"" and ""value of ETH"" are projected to go up, so attacks become increasingly unlikely due to the sheer economic cost involved in doing an attack — *once* — and the absurdity of acquiring that much ETH in the first place if the attack comes from an outside actor (where would you buy 10 million ETH to have 51% of the stake? 20M?)

## 32 ETH is way too much, the average person doesn't have that much

* The reason for such a high number is it has to fall in a technical sweetspot. In a nutshell, it has to be low enough to be accessible and have enough validators to secure the chain, but high enough to not have too many validators and bloat the chain with overhead. And having a fixed amount for each validator reduces some complexity by having each validator weighted exactly the same in the randomness process.

* There is a whole bunch of [math involved](https://thomasborgers.medium.com/ethereum-2-0-economic-review-1fc4a9b8c2d9) to arrive at 32 ETH from a technical standpoint, back when 32 ETH was worth about 7000 USD. [Earlier math from 2017](https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/parametrizing-casper-the-decentralization-finality-time-overhead-tradeoff-3f2011672735) even suggested over 1000 ETH minimum. 

* However I do agree it's a lot. There are some ideas of how it could be lowered ([better signature aggregation](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/rwojtk/ama_we_are_the_efs_research_team_pt_7_07_january/hrmt6o0/) or [a rotating cap of active validators](https://ethresear.ch/t/simplified-active-validator-cap-and-rotation-proposal/9022)) but they don't seem to be very high on the priority list currently.

* Thankfully, just like mining pools exist, there are staking pools to allow staking in smaller amounts. It doesn't necessarily fly in the face of the ""not your keys not your coins"" mantra, thanks to things like [RocketPool](https://rocketpool.net/), [Secret Shared Validators](https://medium.com/coinmonks/secret-shared-validators-on-ethereum-2-0-ea29ab380016) (not yet launched) which use smart contracts to be permissionless, decentralized and non-custodian. And because of the quadratic penalties mentioned above, I believe decentralized staking operations will outperform the centralized ones on the long run. I recommend superphiz's [guide to staking](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethstaker/comments/t1xpr5/how_to_stake_on_ethereum_march_2022_edition/) for more info. And obviously, I admit staking through exchanges is yucky if you value decentralization

## PoS hasn't been proven, while we know PoW works

That's actually totally fair and there is no real rebuttal to this, obviously. Only time will tell. I just think it's irrelevant in the context that Ethereum *is* switching to PoS and was always going to. If you don't believe in it, don't participate/invest in it. I do personally believe in a long term sustainable PoS Ethereum, but even then I'm glad good ol' boring-by-design Bitcoin will be there chugging its proof of work along.

It's all part of the great crypto experiment of our lifetime. Either it's just a fad and will fail into obscurity, which would be a bummer for sure, or we'll have succeeded in creating monster robust networks capable of outlasting humanity. To achieve that, prioritizing decentralization is key. Which is something I mainly just see in Bitcoin and Ethereum, despite the widely different philosophies. It's why I'm glad to have both to truly see what's what on the long term.

The Ethereum network's largest issue right now is scalability. Rollups and other scaling methods strive to improve the end user's overall experience. In a word, Ethereum is the most secure and decentralized blockchain that uses smart contracts in the world. However, because of the tremendous demand for Ethereum blockspace, the network becomes extremely costly for the typical user to use. When the network becomes overloaded, blockspace becomes scarce, forcing users to engage in a bidding war to have their transaction included in the next block.  


But now we have rollups, rollups have two categories or two solutions: ZK rollup and optimistic rollup. For example, we have Metis which uses optimistic rollup with the enhanced layer 2 rollup solution to resolve the wait time through its Metis Virtual Machine (MVM), a virtual machine that is compatible with the Ethereum virtual machine. It separates the computing and storage of the Ethereum construct for layer 2. Thus, we have low gas fees on transactions and shorter wait times when withdrawing.  


Optimistic rollups have been used by protocols such as Optimism and Arbitrum to improve the scalability of Ethereum. Arbitrum and Optimism have seen significant growth in the number of users and TVLs over the last few months. Metis, an Optimism fork, aims to provide another optimistic rollup framework with a different optimization between transaction throughput and decentralization.

Transaction costs on the number one smart contract network have reached their lowest levels in over nine months. While the major cause of the drop is decreased network activity, the number of unique active users on Ethereum has remained steady.   
 

The decrease in network gas prices is related to a decrease in demand for Ethereum block space. Users bid up the price they are willing to pay to have their transactions processed in the next block during periods of heavy congestion since blocks only contain a certain amount of space for transactions. When activity falls, the network reduces the quantity of gas required to meet demand.   
 

While gas fees are low, they won’t necessarily stay that way for long. For that matter, I rely on Kaiba DeFi services. Their DEX reduces the cost of gas by 20-30% but I few times there were more than that and it didn't even affect speed or security. So because this situation won't last, be sure to find a backup solution ASAP.    
 

Low gas prices are certainly a blessing for many Ethereum users. Due to the lower cost of network transactions, traders may now take advantage of smaller trading opportunities, enhancing capital efficiency. For many casual users, the decreased gas prices will be a welcome relief.

While continuing its volatile price movement in the last 24-hour, the current price is still 4% up near $2650. Although the price action is flat, Santiment data suggest a bullish outlook in the future.

Plays KuCoin Token in First Round  **1 seed Ethereum** is playing **16 seed KuCoin Token** in the first round of the 3rd Annual Ultimate Crypto Tournament!

Voting has begun and will run for 3 days. The coin with more votes will move on to the next round to play the winner of: **8**. **Decentraland** vs. **9.** **Ethereum Classic**

For those unfamiliar, this is modeled after March Madness where the top 64 coins face off in a single elimination tournament. The winner moves on and the loser is out. The last coin left is declared the champion.

This is Ethereum’s third straight appearance in the tournament, all as a 1 seed. In 2020, it made it to the Elite 8, defeating Bytom, BAT, and ICON before falling to eventual champion Nano. Last year, it defeated Nexo before losing a tough second round matchup to Tezos. Tell your friends and maybe your frenemies; the more votes the better!

This is a real event, not spam and it’s just for fun. I know that different coins have different functions so it’s sometimes silly to ask “which is better,” but I’m still doing it because I think it’s fun. If this isn’t the type of post for this subReddit, I apologize and won’t post here again.

Trying to better understand Ethereum's PoS more deeply. 

As I understand it, proof of stake requires N (16 or 32 depending on Rocketpool/self-hosted etc) ETH to be deposited into the staking contract in order to be a participant in a slot. 

However, how does this affect new miners who have yet to obtain ETH? In the current system they could obtain mining equipment (at a non-negligible cost for sure, not doubting that) used to validate and be rewarded with ETH, but in PoS since ETH is required to become a validator, I can imagine a catch-22 where users in crypto-sanctioned regions cannot access ways to purchase ETH (other than p2p) to even become a validator in the first place.

So, if we send 100 simultaneous requests to a web server, there would be 100 threads spawn to serve these 100 requests. That's what I'd call asynchronous handling.

Now, 100 transactions are created simultaneously on the Ethereum (or any similar blockchains), how would they be handled. Assume these 100 transactions are initiated by 100 different accounts and the requests are received by different RPC Nodes. Here are what I understand:

Some transactions with higher gas set will have higher priority. Still, in the end, they will have to be in a queue?

Now, one transaction with highest priority is selected, it will be broadcasted to the network (of all miners?) and the race begins. The most powerful node gets to create the block. Or few transactions (say, 10), I don't know, as as to fill up the 1MB limit of one block. In the meantime, what happens to incoming transactions, are they continued to be received and queue up with the other 90 transactions?

That being said, except for the winner node, all the other nodes actually do not help creating the block (they do help validate it though). Is that correct? So the transactions are in fact processed synchronously. Which makes blockchain far from a real distributed system (a distributed database, maybe). Aside from PoW, is it the main reason Ethereum is stuck at roughly 25 TPS?

Some newer blockchains like NEAR may help to improve TPS (100k?) by divide the network into shards and PoS. That does help. But each shard is fundamentally a small chain and still handle transactions in a synchronous manner. If, for some odd reasons, all the accounts initiating lots of simultaneous transactions reside in the same shard, would that cause the same trouble. And if a transaction is not just changing account balance, but performing some tougher calculation, wouldn't it be much worse?

Tl;DR

As long as all the execution data is made available on the mainnet, the chain does not require every node to execute every transaction in order to validate transactions and reach consensus.

Because rollups can cryptographically-guarantee (via a proof) that the transactions are valid, these transactions can now be executed by just a single node and posted to the L1 where it can be cross-checked by L1 nodes.

However, a rollup’s TPS is dependent on the data capacity of their L1 for throughput. The more data capacity on L1, the higher the (theoretical) throughput for rollups. Once an L1 runs out of data capacity for the rollup, the limit has been reached and no additional transactions can be processed. Therefore, now the limiting factor for a blockchain’s scalability is its data availability.

In summary, data availability is extremely important for new modular blockchains for two reasons. First, adequate DA is required to ensure rollup sequencer’s submissions can be cross-checked and challenged if needed. Secondly, DA is now the bottleneck to a blockchain’s scalability. Maximizing the DA on a L1 is critical for rollups to reach their full potential.",-0.9959988594055176,0.2065512265512265,0.5056998556998555,0.073,0.027,0.9,0.7878

But I'm struggling on finding the why, as in why did Vitalik came up with the idea and if there are any citeable resources for that.

Music NFTs offer a way for the artists to get the funding they deserve - and the successful innovators will deliver massive value to collectors, rather than the record label.",0.9994564652442932,0.233103354978355,0.4183170995670995,0.163,0.011,0.826,0.9935

Ethereum is moving to proof of stake. With plans to phase out of proof of work and transition into “The Merge” (formerly known as ETH 2.0) as soon as June 2022 (mid-Q2, or whatever), there are broader implications for both Ethereum and Bitcoin miners – as well as the ASIC market – so it’s important to understand: what is the difference between proof of work and proof of stake, and why should you care? 

Proof of work (PoW), the current [consensus mechanism](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/) used most notably in mining Ethereum and Bitcoin, refers to the underlying algorithm that sets the difficulty and rules for work performed by miners, with “work” referring to mining itself. According to Ethereum’s website, [PoW](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pow/) is important because “the chain’s length helps the network follow the correct Ethereum chain and understand Ethereum’s current state. The more ‘work’ done, the longer the chain, and the higher the block number, the more certain the network can be of the current state of things.”

Proof of stake (PoS), on the other hand, is performed by validators who have staked ETH in order to participate in the system. Chosen at random, a validator creates new blocks and shares them with the network, earning rewards. Intense computational work isn’t necessary as you simply need to have staked your ETH in the network, which is what incentivises healthy network behavior. PoS also requires users to stake their ETH in order to become a validator, who is responsible for the same thing as miners in PoW: ordering transactions and creating new blocks so that all nodes can agree on the state of the network.

*TLDR: PoS (Future) = No more mining, PoW (Present, about to be extinct) = GPU Mining*

## Ethereum is Moving to PoS… Again

Ethereum’s transition to PoS, referred to as “The Merge” or ETH 2.0, is not a recent development. Beginning in 2017, it was originally planned for launch in 2019. Fast forward to 2022, there seems to be much more confidence circulating around this topic, so why are we talking about it again? 

Before we jump into the history lesson, let’s clear up some of the terminology. The Merge refers to the merging of all of the history of ETH 1.0 (all coins, everything) into the ETH 2.0 chain. Once that happens, the mining of Ethereum is no more and the entire blockchain is run by the validator nodes. Of course, if Ethereum can no longer be mined, there is no use for GPUs outside of gaming and the mining of alternative coins, such as Ravencoin, Flux and others. While you can continue mining these coins, the long term profitability is highly questionable and is likely to plummet with the demise of Ethereum mining as we know it. But we’ll get to that in a minute. 

The purpose of a transition to PoS is to make Ethereum scalable, more secure, and more sustainable. No mining means eco-friendly. What makes this scalability possible is something called “shard chains”. Shard chains, or sharding, [is a scaling mechanism](https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/shard-chains/) that is anticipated to go live in 2023. Instead of dealing with the entire blockchain at the same time, you deal in pieces (think “shards” of glass). The purpose of shard chains is to build a more resilient and more scalable blockchain network.

## A Better Picture

It’s important to understand that a transition to PoS from PoW is just that – a transition. PoS presents improvements to the PoW model, merging first before being entirely replaced, as demonstrated in the graphic below. These improvements include improved energy efficiency (as you no longer need energy to *mine* blocks), fewer hardware requirements for creating new blocks, and stronger support for the aforementioned shard chains (the key player in scaling the Ethereum network). A transition to proof of stake is also expected to result in more nodes in the network, which significantly improves resistance to centralization.

## The Merge and The Aftermath

*It’s June 2022 and Ethereum has moved to proof of stake.* What happened to all of the miners who were using GPUs to mine Ethereum? Well, since mining rigs are purpose-built, meaning they’re better for mining one specific coin, the GPUs went back into the hands of gamers while crypto miners dove head first into the ASIC market. 

A significant rise in demand for ASIC mining equipment once Ethereum officially transitions to PoS is not hard to imagine, and that demand is likely to outpace the available supply – a supply which has already been affected by global supply chain disruptions due to Covid-19.

The last 18 months have been very profitable for ETH miners in particular. Many of them began their mining journeys with their personal gaming computers, and have since significantly expanded their mining arsenals by building dedicated GPU mining rigs and farms. This was their first foray into full-time crypto mining, so what now? Well, there’s a slim chance they’ll be willing to give that up, and it’s very likely they’ll keep mining simply because they know mining works. It was these 18 months that helped people see the profit potential, and further turned those who were just exploring their curiosity into hardcore miners.

In light of The Merge, it won’t come as a surprise when these miners sell their used GPUs (gamers rejoice) and start buying ASICs, transitioning to Bitcoin mining. If you’re following our line of logic, an increase in demand and a decrease in supply will cause ASIC prices to jump, making it increasingly difficult to obtain a miner.

## All Roads Lead to Rome

A new wave of buyers is on the way. The influx of GPUs on the secondhand market once the merge occurs will have gamers rejoicing, but they’ll be practically useless for crypto mining. With attention turning to ASICs and Q2 just around the corner, it doesn’t hurt to start thinking about buying an ASIC today to avoid FOMO in the future. 

Bitcoin and Ethereum are not only the top 2 coins based on [market cap](https://uk.advfn.com/cryptocurrency), they’re also the top 2 mineable coins. Ethereum’s market cap is half of Bitcoin’s – based on this alone, considering that market cap correlates with the number of miners per coin, it can be assumed that Ethereum has about half as many miners as Bitcoin. 

In translation? Bitcoin is about to gain 50% more miners, and they’re all coming from Ethereum.

Ethereum is moving to proof of stake. With plans to phase out of proof of work and transition into “The Merge” (formerly known as ETH 2.0) as soon as June 2022 (mid-Q2, or whatever), there are broader implications for both Ethereum and Bitcoin miners – as well as the ASIC market – so it’s important to understand: what is the difference between proof of work and proof of stake, and why should you care? 

Proof of work (PoW), the current [consensus mechanism](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/) used most notably in mining Ethereum and Bitcoin, refers to the underlying algorithm that sets the difficulty and rules for work performed by miners, with “work” referring to mining itself. According to Ethereum’s website, [PoW](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pow/) is important because “the chain’s length helps the network follow the correct Ethereum chain and understand Ethereum’s current state. The more ‘work’ done, the longer the chain, and the higher the block number, the more certain the network can be of the current state of things.”

Proof of stake (PoS), on the other hand, is performed by validators who have staked ETH in order to participate in the system. Chosen at random, a validator creates new blocks and shares them with the network, earning rewards. Intense computational work isn’t necessary as you simply need to have staked your ETH in the network, which is what incentivises healthy network behavior. PoS also requires users to stake their ETH in order to become a validator, who is responsible for the same thing as miners in PoW: ordering transactions and creating new blocks so that all nodes can agree on the state of the network.

*TLDR: PoS (Future) = No more mining, PoW (Present, about to be extinct) = GPU Mining*

## Ethereum is Moving to PoS… Again

Ethereum’s transition to PoS, referred to as “The Merge” or ETH 2.0, is not a recent development. Beginning in 2017, it was originally planned for launch in 2019. Fast forward to 2022, there seems to be much more confidence circulating around this topic, so why are we talking about it again? 

Before we jump into the history lesson, let’s clear up some of the terminology. The Merge refers to the merging of all of the history of ETH 1.0 (all coins, everything) into the ETH 2.0 chain. Once that happens, the mining of Ethereum is no more and the entire blockchain is run by the validator nodes. Of course, if Ethereum can no longer be mined, there is no use for GPUs outside of gaming and the mining of alternative coins, such as Ravencoin, Flux and others. While you can continue mining these coins, the long term profitability is highly questionable and is likely to plummet with the demise of Ethereum mining as we know it. But we’ll get to that in a minute. 

The purpose of a transition to PoS is to make Ethereum scalable, more secure, and more sustainable. No mining means eco-friendly. What makes this scalability possible is something called “shard chains”. Shard chains, or sharding, [is a scaling mechanism](https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/shard-chains/) that is anticipated to go live in 2023. Instead of dealing with the entire blockchain at the same time, you deal in pieces (think “shards” of glass). The purpose of shard chains is to build a more resilient and more scalable blockchain network.

## A Better Picture

It’s important to understand that a transition to PoS from PoW is just that – a transition. PoS presents improvements to the PoW model, merging first before being entirely replaced, as demonstrated in the graphic below. These improvements include improved energy efficiency (as you no longer need energy to *mine* blocks), fewer hardware requirements for creating new blocks, and stronger support for the aforementioned shard chains (the key player in scaling the Ethereum network). A transition to proof of stake is also expected to result in more nodes in the network, which significantly improves resistance to centralization.

## The Merge and The Aftermath

*It’s June 2022 and Ethereum has moved to proof of stake.* What happened to all of the miners who were using GPUs to mine Ethereum? Well, since mining rigs are purpose-built, meaning they’re better for mining one specific coin, the GPUs went back into the hands of gamers while crypto miners dove head first into the ASIC market. 

A significant rise in demand for ASIC mining equipment once Ethereum officially transitions to PoS is not hard to imagine, and that demand is likely to outpace the available supply – a supply which has already been affected by global supply chain disruptions due to Covid-19.

The last 18 months have been very profitable for ETH miners in particular. Many of them began their mining journeys with their personal gaming computers, and have since significantly expanded their mining arsenals by building dedicated GPU mining rigs and farms. This was their first foray into full-time crypto mining, so what now? Well, there’s a slim chance they’ll be willing to give that up, and it’s very likely they’ll keep mining simply because they know mining works. It was these 18 months that helped people see the profit potential, and further turned those who were just exploring their curiosity into hardcore miners.

In light of The Merge, it won’t come as a surprise when these miners sell their used GPUs (gamers rejoice) and start buying ASICs, transitioning to Bitcoin mining. If you’re following our line of logic, an increase in demand and a decrease in supply will cause ASIC prices to jump, making it increasingly difficult to obtain a miner.

## All Roads Lead to Rome

A new wave of buyers is on the way. The influx of GPUs on the secondhand market once the merge occurs will have gamers rejoicing, but they’ll be practically useless for crypto mining. With attention turning to ASICs and Q2 just around the corner, it doesn’t hurt to start thinking about buying an ASIC today to avoid FOMO in the future. 

Bitcoin and Ethereum are not only the top 2 coins based on [market cap](https://uk.advfn.com/cryptocurrency), they’re also the top 2 mineable coins. Ethereum’s market cap is half of Bitcoin’s – based on this alone, considering that market cap correlates with the number of miners per coin, it can be assumed that Ethereum has about half as many miners as Bitcoin. 

In translation? Bitcoin is about to gain 50% more miners, and they’re all coming from Ethereum.

So many rumors; information impossible to find; most questions on Ethereum subs on Reddit not answered.  Ethereum need an actual audit to answer questions we have.  This would help with the trust we need to keep putting our money into this project.  I don't know who would do this, as there are so many accounting firms that are just corporate tools.  Are there any honest ones?  

Some points that need to be cleared up:

1. Who uses Ethereum?  Lots of answers to the question, ""Who is actually using Ethereum, other than other Coin projects and Ethereum miners?"" is answered with links to major banks and companies than are heavily invested in blockchain tech, with huge companies and '80%+' of the top 100 corporations in the world.""  But Ethereum and blockchain are two separate things.  Companies and banks are using blockchain, but it's their own blockchains.  They are verified by the Ethereum chain; it seems like they just copy and pasted the open-sourced software that other chains use.  I know that blockchain will eventually run everything, but how does Ethereum fit into that?  If Wells Fargo or Walmart use blockchain, will it be verified by the Ethereum blockchain?  Why?  To show us that they're honest?  If that was the case they would just post the opensourced software underneath their blockchain to show us it's real number
2. Keep reading rumors that the new Ethereum 2 blockchain has pre-mined  and that over 70% that will go straight to Mr Buterin and some other big players who will effectively control over 51% of the Ether created in Eth2.  Is this true?  Not true?  Some 'white paper' that spells this out?  Vitalik Buterin looks like a decent enough guy but that's not enough to quell my fears that he's not a Elon Musk in training.  Musk and other billionaires need to be seen as cool or interesting with good PR to keep being billionaires.  It's all part of the game to convince us that having vast amounts of wealth is somehow OK.  So is this 70%of new Eth2 being pocketed real?  
3. Ethereum is decentralized and that no-one runs in it.  Utter nonsense.  Obviously there are changes to the project and new things are introduced all the time.  All we hear or read tells us that 51% have control over any changes with Ethereum, but who decides?  Obviously someone like Buterin gets a huge say.  Any questions I have about how 'voting' is done for changes are met with terse answers like, ""No one controls it!  You need more than 51%!""  Or, ""The miners control what they mine and which software they use!""  So, miners get a vote?  Are they sent emails asking if new changes in Ethereum is OK with them?  Or is it a group somewhere that decides?  If so, who are they?  How does the whole process work?  Again, answers are all in the vein of, ""Once level 5 ei77543 are implemented in the new iteration of m653 protocols then the MMG protocols will be integrated with the ENS system on block 557689.""  Made that up, of course, but the deep insider codespeak helps no one who isn't that deep into it understand *anything* about changes.  
4. How is this funded?  There are obviously a lot of coders working on this.  Do the leaders (and please don't tell me there 'are no leaders, dummy!"") make money?  Promises of a share of Eth?  Eth they already own?  And if so, how will that work for the future of our Ethereum?  Again, where does the money come from?  Where is it going?  In the future, if Ether becomes a security, how will the average buyer get paid if the cost of Ether goes up?  What is the end game, if not becoming a new currency.  

These are probably questions that have been already asked and answered in clearly defined language that I just haven't found yet.  Just like to know how much money the developers and management people have and where they got it and how much they will get in the future and how.  If it's a big payday for them then great, they deserve it, for creating and developing it.  But where is the open-sourced immutable blockchain open ledger of all money spent on Ethereum and where it came from and where it went?  Isn't that one of the purposes of Ethereum?  I know that it's supposed to be  untraceable, as we're reminded daily, that Ethereum is only for drug lords and money launderers, which is why we should give our money to it.  This, again, is complete nonsense.  Ethereum starts in a bank.  It is absolutely traceable.  If someone scammed me out of $500.00 and I complained, nothing would be done.  If I lost $20 million dollars the hashes would be traced a thousand times to find out where my stolen money was and be recovered in a week.  

If everything I'm saying has already been addressed, please send links to what basic questions have been answered and how I can find it explained without being a inner-circle coder/developer.  

Still a big fan and pouring more money than I should into it, although I still have my original stake, which I took out during the highs, and then some.  Enough to get a new car and the laptop I'm typing this on.  But at this point I think a clear, well written explanation of Ethereum and the entire project needs to be written up in clear language by some independent auditor that has experienced people in virtual currency and methods.  I mean, as opposed to a regular accountancy firm that has no fucking clue what or how the internet works.  

That's why I joined Reddit a month or so ago.  I had to wait a month before posting (I can see that- due to bots and paid trolls) but really, I can't seem to get a straight answer on Reddit, message boards, etc, etc.  I guess I'm just not a 'just trust us!' kind of guy.  Although, to be fair, I do kind of trust you.  I mean, Vitalik does give off a kind of 'good guy/ Pewdiepie' sort of vibe.  

It just seems sometimes that Ethereum prices jump up really fast, like whales are investing to pump it up.  Then, once we've invested it suddenly drops dramatically.  It seems that we fill up the coffers with our money; the whales take their profit, then the whole cycle starts all over.  I personally put money in when I see everyone online, (and on late night TV shows) make jokes about what losers we are for investing in crypto.  Then, when I see lots of stories and articles about the future of Ethereum and how the 'flippening' is happening and how some country somewhere is going to make crypto their new money, or some bank is going to integrate it into their portfolio; (normally a slew of Yahoo Finance articles touting crypto's rise); then I sell.  

Again- still love me some Ethereum and DCA-ing.  Just want more of it and everything involved out in the open.  Don't want to find out years from now that five billionaires discovered that this was the future and decided to buy it out, giving themselves the lion's share and us, again, being in the 99%, with them in the 1%.

A Music NFT is a first of a kind asset for music that allows collectors to stake value in an artist’s success or IP. The NFT’s success will depend on the artist’s ability to drive value, regardless of any “royalty split”.
2. New NFT Category. If you’re reading this, you’re super early to Music NFTs. Collectors are still focused on jpegs and pfps, which have much higher volume that the music category. Getting in early on an emerging market is the way to make big gains. Volume is coming.
3. Content / Marketing. With Music NFTs, you get everything a jpeg has and more. The music itself is utility, and provides the long term marketing plan as the artist’s career grows. Music NFTs have so much content behind them. The NFT is a connection to the success of the content
4. Onboarding Masses. In my opinion Music NFTs will be one of the best categories for onboarding the mainstream. Music is consumed by so many people who might not be as interested in other types of art NFTs. Furthermore, features like live events &amp; merch are more easily explained
5. The Artists. We all know that the music industry has a reputation for predatory deals with artists.

A Music NFT is a first of a kind asset for music that allows collectors to stake value in an artist’s success or IP. The NFT’s success will depend on the artist’s ability to drive value, regardless of any “royalty split”.
2. New NFT Category. If you’re reading this, you’re super early to Music NFTs. Collectors are still focused on jpegs and pfps, which have much higher volume that the music category. Getting in early on an emerging market is the way to make big gains. Volume is coming.
3. Content / Marketing. With Music NFTs, you get everything a jpeg has and more. The music itself is utility, and provides the long term marketing plan as the artist’s career grows. Music NFTs have so much content behind them. The NFT is a connection to the success of the content
4. Onboarding Masses. In my opinion Music NFTs will be one of the best categories for onboarding the mainstream. Music is consumed by so many people who might not be as interested in other types of art NFTs. Furthermore, features like live events &amp; merch are more easily explained
5. The Artists. We all know that the music industry has a reputation for predatory deals with artists. Music NFTs offer a way for the artists to get the funding they deserve - and the successful innovators will deliver massive value to collectors, rather than the record label.",0.9991003274917604,0.2545757575757576,0.4325151515151516,0.178,0.013,0.81,0.9929

5. The Artists. We all know that the music industry has a reputation for predatory deals with artists. Music NFTs offer a way for the artists to get the funding they deserve - and the successful innovators will deliver massive value to collectors, rather than the record label.

Ethereum The first lie is that ethereum, and many other cryptocurrency projects claim to be “decentralized”. If you asked 100 people in the ethereum camp what “decentralized” means, they’ll generally respond with a vague answer that, in essence, says either no one controls the project, or, everyone has a say in the project. 


Let's examine the belief of ‘no one controls the project’. Let's examine if this statement is true or not. If no one controls the project, that means no one can make the rules. If no one controls the project, it means that miners can create extra coins out of thin air because ‘no one controls the project’. Users would be able to create coins out of thin air as well because ‘no one controls the project’. Being that users and miners of ethereum can not create new coins out of thin air means ‘no one controls the project’ is misinformation. 

On the opposite end of the spectrum, we can take a look at the statement of  ‘everyone has a say’ in the project, and see if this statement regarding “decentralization” is true or not. This statement is designed to make people involved in the project feel like they have some sort of power in telling someone else how the project should be controlled. If this were the case, then a miner would say that he should be granted more coins because he pays more for his electricity than other miners. And, since ‘everyone has a say’ in the project, he would be given extra coins. Obviously, this is not the case either. 

We have addressed both statements in their contexts, and concluded that, in the context of “decentralized”, the two statements are false. We can now start to explain how bitcoin really works. But, before we do that, I want to explore a little deeper on why the two statements of “decentralized” seem to resonate with the majority of the crypto space.

Claiming that ‘no one controls it’ or ‘everyone controls it’ sounds somewhat poetic. It sounds like a flower in the wild that can grow on it’s own, yet can be watered and enjoyed by everyone. This is why the statement and sentiment is so popular in this space. Yet, if you try to apply either of the statements to the real world, they don't hold water. If a miner believes that no one can control the project, and issues himself an extra 5000 bitcoins, it wouldn’t work. To the same extent, if a miner believed ‘everyone controlled the project’ and tried to reward himself 5000 bitcoins, that, too, wouldn’t work. 

The issuer of Ethereum, Vitalik Beuterin, wants people to believe that he isn’t in control of Ethereum. He wants to distance himself as much as he can from his own project. This is because of the fraud  committed during the ICO days of Ethereum. And the shenanigans continues to this day. The truth is that Vitalik is the issuer of Ethereum. 

An ICO is nothing new, despite what the millennials are made to believe. An initial coin offering is regulated by the SEC. The practice of creating and issuing tokens to be traded for profit has been going on before the 1960’s. Just because the tokens are digital, doesn’t make a difference to the SEC. A claim for scalping (fraud) is generally one involving promoters of securities. Here is an SEC case may seem familiar:

“In a related scheme, the Commission charges that Czuczko touted shares of his own company, Epic Media, Inc. Epic Media, based in Los Angeles, is a development stage company with plans to publish “lifestyle magazines” for men and women. Czuczko is Epic Media’s CEO and CFO, and chairman of the company’s board of directors, as well as its majority shareholder. The Commission alleges that in early December 2005 Czuczko recommended the purchase of Epic Media stock on a website that was the predecessor to the Stockster site. After the price of Epic Media stock spiked, Czuczko sold his shares for a small profit. Czuczko did not publicly disclose those trades, among others, in stock ownership forms required to be filed with the Commission under federal securities laws.” 

Most individuals purchased Ethereums ICO, not as a utility, but as a security. They purchased to make money from the rising price. This practice is regulated by the SEC. Vitalik did not register with the SEC prior to his Ethereum ICO in 2014. 

Further more, when a developer, or issuer changes the protocol of a a blockchain project, they are in fact, issuing new tokens. That means, whenever there is a fork of any kind, the issuer(s) are issuing new tokens, different from the previous token. We’ll discuss this in more detail later. 

For now, realize that Ethereum has several red flags, including fraud-like behavior. Also, Ethereum’s issuer is actively trying to distance himself from the project to avoid accountability. And most of the Ethereum believers are under the spell that ethereum is decentralized with no one being held accountable for new tokens set to be issued in the coming fork. 


When bitcoin was released in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto, all 21 million tokens were created and released to the world. The protocol was set in stone in 2009. No more bitcoin tokens could be created per the protocol. All of the bitcoin protocols were created, and couldn’t be changed at the base level.

I posted about my project in the ethdev sub and it was well-received so I'm hoping y'all will find it interesting too.

I've been working on a synthetic loot spinoff for my latest project, synthetic punks. It generates a unique, fully on-chain cryptopunk based on your wallet address. It's also optionally claimable as an NFT. 

Hoping to do more of these inclusive NFT projects in the future so feedback is appreciated :)

Harpie is a simple way to protect your crypto tokens from accidental loss, key destruction, hacks, and theft. Harpie connects to all of your Ethereum wallets and gives you the power to protect an unlimited number of tokens and NFTs from loss. Harpie is non-custodial and zero-knowledge, meaning that we never hold your tokens or keys.

We have three major features planned, and we launched the first today:

\- Key loss and destruction protection (launched)

\- Hack prevention w/ MEV frontrunners

\- Decentralized crypto succession planning

# Why does Harpie exist?

Since the dawn of digital currencies, keeping your crypto safe has always been tricky. There's never been a ""right"" way to protect your crypto assets. Just writing down keys and using hardware wallets isn't enough: you're still vulnerable to losing your crypto from hacks, thefts, and even loss of life.

We built Harpie with the vision of becoming a simple to use security standard. It shouldn't take years of crypto experience to be confident in your security: it should take minutes.

# How does it work?

Loss prevention: We set up an email/local-encrypted signer and Approve it with your tokens. Whenever you need to make a recovery, you can access that signer via your email and transfer tokens out of your lost wallet.

Hack prevention: You set up an address book of trusted contacts. We help you set up a MEV frontrunner. Your frontrunner will scan the mempool and outbid malicious transactions to addresses outside of your book.

Succession planning: We set up a decentralized executor that relies on m-of-n consensus of delegated executors (can be family, lawyers, etc). When consensus is met, assets are distributed based on a preallocated delegation.

More details can be found in the whitepaper.

(Follow-up) I posted earlier about the possibility of getting Bitcoin owners to swap their Bitcoins for Ethereum.  It kinda got all over the place, so I (learning something from that post) want to rephrase the premise.

If half of Bitcoin owners went onto Coinbase right now and swapped their Bitcoin for Ethereum would that be a good or bad thing for Ethereum?  

Is there *no way* that the leaders of Ethereum, or a third party could offer a 'bonus' for swapped Ethereum from Bitcoin owners that took the deal, say .50% for each 6 months you stake your converted, newly minted Ethereum, payable on day 1.  

Vitalik Buterin comes down from the mountain offering a .50% bonus for swapped Bitcoin to Ether; *then*, that same money makes \~5% by being staked.  So anyone swapping their Bitcoin for Ethereum gets a .50% bonus; plus \~5% interest once being staked and, once the Ether is unstaked gets a presumably  higher value stash of Ether once the one year staking period is over.  And for the bonus Ethereum gets the money needed to have a virtual shit ton of staked cash for the transition to Eth2.

The Ethereum, that was previously Bitcoin that's been *swapped* would be locked in as 'staked' for one year, to prevent people reselling their Ethereum just to get the swapping bonus again and again, with the added benefit of having a larger vault of staked Ether for the Eth2 transition.   

What would Bitcoin do?  Offer a bigger bonus for anyone swapping their new Ether back into Bitcoin?  Can they do that?  I know the money isn't in a vault somewhere like at a bank.  I'm just saying that if a bank offered me .50% interest in my money if I deposit it, I'd jump at it.  And if I tried to take the money out and reinvest it in the bank they would tell me, ""No, you can't do that- you were here yesterday.  Once only.""  

I guess I'm asking, is there a way to make that happen?  Can Ethereum not do something that a Wells Fargo can do?  Can the leaders of Ethereum implement a smart contract that somehow, using someone's money find a way to bribe Bitcoin owners to swap their money for Ethtereum?  Or someone else?  An internet group with the resources to make that happen?

Just a dream of Ethereum putting Bitcoin out of business.  Because I like Ethereum and want to have the market cap of Ether and Bitcoin added together under the control (so to speak) of the Ethereum team.  Who would take on cryptocurrencies with that kind of power?  

Again, if half of Bitcoin owners went to Coinbase and swapped their Bitcoin for Ethereum (I did it), how would that be bad?  I myself would not want to stake my money in Ethereum, since I'm convinced I'd make more just buying it right out.  But plenty of people would stake for one year with a .50% bonus and a 5% APR for a year.",-0.9998676776885986,0.0370820001254783,0.4639390802434281,0.082,0.017,0.901,0.9775

Vitalik Buterin comes down from the mountain offering a .50% bonus for swapped Bitcoin to Ether; *then*, that same money makes \~5% by being staked.  So anyone swapping their Bitcoin for Ethereum gets a .50% bonus; plus \~5% interest once being staked and, once the Ether is unstaked gets a presumably  higher value stash of Ether once the one year staking period is over.  And for the bonus Ethereum gets the money needed to have a virtual shit ton of staked cash for the transition to Eth2.

The Ethereum, that was previously Bitcoin that's been *swapped* would be locked in as 'staked' for one year, to prevent people reselling their Ethereum just to get the swapping bonus again and again, with the added benefit of having a larger vault of staked Ether for the Eth2 transition.   

What would Bitcoin do?  Offer a bigger bonus for anyone swapping their new Ether back into Bitcoin?  Can they do that?  I know the money isn't in a vault somewhere like at a bank.  I'm just saying that if a bank offered me .50% interest in my money if I deposit it, I'd jump at it.  And if I tried to take the money out and reinvest it in the bank they would tell me, ""No, you can't do that- you were here yesterday.  Once only.""  

I guess I'm asking, is there a way to make that happen?  Can Ethereum not do something that a Wells Fargo can do?  Can the leaders of Ethereum implement a smart contract that somehow, using someone's money find a way to bribe Bitcoin owners to swap their money for Ethtereum?  Or someone else?  An internet group with the resources to make that happen?

Just a dream of Ethereum putting Bitcoin out of business.  Because I like Ethereum and want to have the market cap of Ether and Bitcoin added together under the control (so to speak) of the Ethereum team.  Who would take on cryptocurrencies with that kind of power?  

Again, if half of Bitcoin owners went to Coinbase and swapped their Bitcoin for Ethereum (I did it), how would that be bad?  I myself would not want to stake my money in Ethereum, since I'm convinced I'd make more just buying it right out.  But plenty of people would stake for one year with a .50% bonus and a 5% APR for a year.",-0.9998676776885986,0.0370820001254783,0.4639390802434281,0.082,0.017,0.901,0.9775

The big selling point of Ethereum is that it has the ability to work in 'smart contracts' so that it can be used for everyday purposes.  Bitcoin, by design, can't change in any way unless it has 51% of the owners agreeing to any change.  There are many articles I've read saying that 30-40% of Bitcoins are lost forever, mostly bought years ago, put on a USB drive then lost, in landfills, etc.  

Since the possibility of 51% of Bitcoin owners could never possibly agree on something so big as to change the underlying code, since 40% of them couldn't vote anyway, and since Ethereum has the capability to put in a contract for the purchase of Bitcoin at say, .50% (I know, a lot) profit upon purchase, then why not?  

Bitcoin owners could exchange their money, via an Ethereum contract at .50% in one day.  The window for this would be open for say, six months.  After that, the price of exchanging your Bitcoin for Ethereum would drop to .25%.

Thoughts?  Is this plausible?

Some Core Developers started to think they are ""overpaying"" for security, and that there is a need to replace Proof of Work with a cheaper alternative. The truth is that they don't pay for anything. The rewards miners get the newly generated coins created by the chain, resulting in slight inflation on Ethereum. Inflation means that all Ethereum holders pay for security, not Ethereum Foundation or anyone else. It's also worth noting that EIP-1559 has made the inflation near-zero by introducing the fee burn that yet, has given almost no price increase at all. That makes the security PoW provides effectively free under current network conditions.

Nonetheless, Ethereum's executives ignored all the above and proposed ""The Merge""—a plan to switch Ethereum to Proof of Stake before Ethereum 2.0, citing the ""expensiveness"" of Proof of Work. But they were silent about what security changes will take place if the Merge goes through.

***Reminder for newbies:*** *The merge will not make Ethereum more scalable.*

## Understanding the Blockchain Trilemma

There is a law in the world of Blockchain, a trilemma that says that you can cover fully only two from Decentralization, Security, and Scalability. Taking an equal amount from each corner is impossible too, as getting close to taking the same amount from each corner is exponentially harder.

In this article I will use the Fractional variant of the Blockchain Trilemma. Fractional means that it allows partial selection of three corners, thus reflecting real-world blockchains, as most of them cover the sides of the triangle partially.

Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency, was not designed to scale. Scalability was not important at early times, as there weren't as many users as we have in modern days. Bitcoin is secure and decentralized. Satoshi has incorporated all security features a public ledger may have. Ethereum followed the same path. The creators of Ethereum focused on creating a secure and reliable blockchain, but it didn't scale.

Later on, cryptocurrency adoption has only grown. Fees became higher and higher, along with the need for increased TPS capacity. It was 2017 when fees momentarily exceeded $10 per transaction. The need for scalability was as high as never was before.

Increased fees led to the creation of scalability coins—EOS, TRON, Dash, and others were all about increasing TPS a single blockchain can handle. During the development of most of those projects, there was an insane amount of hype from the community. An excellent example for this would be EOS — the ""Ethereum Killer,"" as many termed it. There have been a lot of ""Ethereum Killers,"" but as you see now, none of them have succeeded.

## Why you should care?

Although ""Ethereum killers"" scaled a lot more, they have failed because they lacked either security or decentralization—the crucial aspects of any blockchain.

Ethereum killers have suffered either Security or Decentralization to allow room for scalability, and without both of those, they have experienced an imminent failure.

The Merge is going to make Ethereum witness the same story.

## What will early Merge do to Ethereum?

***NOTE****: By early merge, I mean the merge that developers plan to be deploy in 2022. Ideally, the Merge (aka the switch to Proof of Stake) should be deployed along with sharding. The early merge takes away the security benefits of PoW without adding the scalability benefits of PoS, effectivelly making Ethereum worse as it will neither scale nor be secure as with PoW.*

Proof of Stake is much less secure than Proof of Work. This is a fact.

There are some studies about the PoW vs. PoS security, but almost all of them, including [Vitalik Buterin's paper](https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/11/06/pos2020.html), talked about the cost of attacks. At the end, they came up with conclusion that PoS will be more expensive to attack, which is completely not true.

With the current network hashrate, to get 50% of Ethereum's network hashrate you will have to get 5 million RTX 3090 GPUs, the price of which ranges around $3000 per GPU. It will cost $15 Billion to acquire that amount of GPUs. But even if you had that much money to invest into the hardware, it would be impossible to buy them as there aren't that many GPUs available in the entire world. It would take decades, if not centuries, to produce them. Renting them would be also impossible, as no supply reaches at least a fraction of the requiremenets.

Adding more to that, to acquire 50% of Ethereum PoS's voting power, you will need only $12 Billion. And I'm not even talking about that the mining hardware is illiquid, and that there won't be as much supply in the near future which the 51% attack requires. Even if you have finally ready to attack after decades of preparations, the network hashrate could be 100x of current values already.

Ethereum researchers are not talking about the consequences of the attacks made. With PoW, the worst (and the only) attack the chain may experience is the chain reorganization attack (aka 51% attack). At most, it can revert a transaction that was made during the attack. In theory, attacks like this require around 51% of the network hashrate, but realistically, the attacker would need to get more than 60% to ensure that the attack will be successful.

Unlike with PoW, with Ethereum 2.0's proof of stake, if 66% of validators ""team-up"" together, they will be able to legally, without violating chain rules kick out the remaining share of validators and take the full control of block production on Ethereum. The attacker will be able to to whatever they want with the network, this includes censoring transactions, freezing (taking down) the network, arbitrarily altering the transaction ordering, and more. This also means that the attacker could blacklist all new validator registrations (of course, if at first the chain was not taken down completely), essentially taking a full control of the chain permanently, with the only solution being implementing a hard fork similar to the DAO fork that will forcefully slash the exploited validators. 66% of network validators ""teaming-up"" is not impossible. There could be a financial incentive to do so (e.g. to kick out the remaining 33% of validators and thus increase the profitability by 33%), or the validator keys may be leaked. Exploiting validators with vulnerabilities that allow to gain access to the validator private key is a major threat, as the validator keys is the only reqiurement to take control of a certain validator.

Decentralization becomes worse too. To stake on Ethereum, you will be required to have 32 ETH (close to $100,000 USD at the time of writing this article). This will mean that only rich people will be able to validate. With PoW, there are no requirements. If you have a gaming PC, you can start mining right away without any additional investments at all.

As you see, some massive security holes will be introduced. That is acceptable when it is a tradeoff to allow scalability, yet the early Merge is not going to incorporate it.

## So what's the point of Ethereum 2.0?

Ethereum 2.0 is meant to achieve the middle point in the Blockchain Trilemma. It will be somewhat scalable, somewhat secure, and somewhat decentralized. With Proof of Stake and further Sharding, Ethereum will lose its superior security. People who want security will move their savings to secure Proof-of-Work blockchains like Bitcoin and the coin that will capture Ethereum's hashpower, and use L2s for micropayments if needed.

## So what the rushed merge without the sharding will do?

The current position of Ethereum in the Blockchain Trilemma is Security and Decentralization. With the rushed Merge (aka Proof of Stake without Sharding), Ethereum will gain 2.0's middle ground security and decentralization without bringing scalability for which the Proof of Stake was invented (Casper PoS is a requirement for sharding).

Core developers will effectively make Ethereum suicide if early Merge without Sharding goes through.

Below you can see Ethereum's position in the blockchain trilemma right now (with PoW), after rushed Merge, and after the full PoS merge with sharding.

Ethereum with PoW (what we have right now):

If the rushed Merge without sharding will happen, this is how it will look like:

https://preview.redd.it/jk41r29duyg81.png?width=500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a0bb25a4bc66cd2f88c6073f42adac9d21274982

And the Merge with sharding will be:

Ethereum with PoW covers most of security and decentralization, but it lacks scalability as Proof of Work doesn't scale. On the other hand, PoS allows scalability (via sharding), but it offers much worse security. PoS without sharding (2022 Early Merge plan) will have the worst coverage of the Blockchain Trilemma, as it will use less secure Proof of Stake that was made to allow scalability, but without incorporating it.

## Summary

As we have learned above, the cryptocurrencies that have poor ""coverage"" of the Blockchain Trilemma fail inevitably. If Merge happens, Ethereum's coverage will be one of the worst ever, making it look the same as ""Ethereum Killers,"" who experienced or are yet to experience failure.

ERC 721 should be scrapped. Blockchain has it's uses but current enviornment is doing more bad than good for adoption of this tech. As Vitalik once said if you can manage with Excel you don't need blockchain, but in todays cryptosphere it is more of Excel is outdated because blockchain. I guess greed, anarchy and lack of ethics are the main drivers of the current trends. Somethings are to change but current direction that I see is ETH burning itself to ground.

Blob Carrying Transactions: Vitalik's New Transaction Type for Rollup

“blob-carrying transactions” which contain a large amount of data that cannot be accessed by EVM execution, but whose commitment can be accessed.

\*\*Commitment: A cryptographic technique that allows a predetermined value to be disclosed in a hidden state from others for a certain period of time, and then the promised value can be disclosed later.

In other words, it is said that it will provide a means to process rolled-up transactions cheaper, more, faster and more efficiently.

You may have heard about the next generation of Ethereum scaling solutions, seen a little bit of chatter about starks, snarks and roll-ups, or even come across the hashtag #L222 - and wanted to dip a toe in and actually try it out rather than just reading about it?

As pointed out in the 2021 Year in Ethereum review, scaling is not only already here, but devs and users are already migrating and the next wave of innovative DeFi, NFT and Gaming projects are launching: [https://stark.mirror.xyz/q3OnsK7mvfGtTQ72nfoxLyEV5lfYOqUfJIoKBx7BG1I](https://stark.mirror.xyz/q3OnsK7mvfGtTQ72nfoxLyEV5lfYOqUfJIoKBx7BG1I)

Over time, less and less dApps will even launch on L1 and many will be L2 only, so it's time to save yourself some fees and get moving to the next frontier of Web3.

If you're ready to be early to the next wave, then today is the day. Sunday is the quietest day of the week for blockspace demand and the time that bridging your hard earned ETH becomes cheapest. There's no better time to take the leap. Quick, before the apes decide to mint another 10k jpegs! [https://www.gasprice.io/](https://www.gasprice.io/)

Plus, you might even get some airdrops for being early: [https://www.layer2dao.org/](https://www.layer2dao.org/)

Firstly, I'll note that the Ethereum roadmap is rapidly evolving, so whatever you may have read is already out of date. Here, I'll briefly describe the state of affairs in February 2022. 

# Rollups

Rollups are layer 2 chains that fully inherit Ethereum's security, decentralization, liquidity &amp; network effect properties. [Multiple rollups are live today](https://l2beat.com/), with application-specific rollups like dYdX, zkSync 1.x and Loopring mature &amp; optimized already. Smart contract rollups like Optimism, Arbitrum and StarkNet are in their early stages and awaiting optimizations through 2022. 

Optimized rollups today are capable of $0.10 transaction fees with up to 4,500 TPS. Certain highly optimized rollups like dYdX can even scale up to 12,000 TPS. The likes of dYdX, Immutable X and Loopring actually have zero gas fees for trades as it's abstracted from the user. But this is just the beginning. This is like smart contracts in 2016. 

The next question becomes - how can we push rollups further? 

1) Rollups and application developers themselves will continue to optimize. We have seen Optimism decrease transaction fees by 30% in January, with another 30% cut due soon. Arbitrum also cut their fees in January, with Arbitrum Nitro estimated to slash fees by 50%. This will continue throughout 2022. [Aave developer Emilio describes](https://twitter.com/The3D_/status/1485732340571807745) how they have reduced transaction fees 10x to $0.16-$0.25 on optimistic rollups through optimizations. These are some examples - costs on rollups will continue to decrease over time as they mature. 

2) Unlike L1s, rollups get cheaper the more activity there is. So as rollups mature, there's more activity, and token incentives, we'll see rollups get cheaper. 

# The Surge

The Surge are upgrades to Ethereum consists of multiple steps that will open the floodgates for rollups. First, we will have intermediate steps like [EIP-4488](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4488) or [blob-carrying transactions](https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/blob_transactions_simple). These will drop transaction fees by 5 times or more, over and above the two points described above. At least one of these intermediate steps is likely to be implemented in Shanghai around the end of 2022. 

The final stage for The Surge is [danksharding](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/sh1trh/danksharding/). This integrates data availability sampling, and ushers in a new paradigm for blockchains. With data availability sampling, the more decentralized your network is, the more capacity there is for rollups. As bandwidth improves and Ethereum decentralizes, capacity will continue to increase. Over the years, there'll be enough to have millions of TPS across rollups - enough so the whole concept of TPS and transaction fees melts away. We'll be sitting and laughing about the time we used to worry about gas fees. Danksharding will roll out over time, with the first steps likely happening in 2023. 

# Statelessness &amp; zkEVM 

With The Surge, rollups will have massive scale and ultra low transaction fees. But Ethereum L1 will still be expensive. This doesn't matter because the end users will all be on rollups. But Ethereum L1 will also scale, first through statelessness, and then several years down the line with zkEVM. Even then, the cheapest fees will continue to be on rollups, which is why most people will just use rollups.",0.8315081000328064,0.0996117524450858,0.4171054192720859,0.158,0.03,0.813,0.9978

TL;DR: *Inflation* of a fiat currency erodes savings and *deflation* can bankrupt debtors, slow down economic activity, and lead to unemployment. Central banks balance by targeting a 2 % inflation, keeping some margin for lowering nominal interest rates to 0 % in recessions. For Ethereum, the potential issue with deflation is restricted to slower economic activity. Participants have two attractive choices in the proof-of-stake ecosystem, locking up their tokens for staking or participating in the smart-contract economy. Issuance of new tokens to stakers is the only source of inflation in the system. Inflation can thus be produced by increasing the yield, but this will slow down activity, not increase it, since it incentivizes people to lock up their tokens for staking instead of interacting with smart contracts. A deflationary Ethereum where the burn rate is higher than the issuance rate attracts capital and developers that wish to capture that capital. Thus, deflation is economically sound for Ethereum considering its forthcoming proof-of-stake consensus.

\--------------------------------------------------------

From time to time, it is suggested that cryptocurrencies should be inflationary like fiat currencies so that users are motivated to spend their tokens, not just hold them. It is important to understand the difference between a central bank trying to balance the desire for high employment and low steady inflation of its fiat currency system with that of a proof-of-stake cryptocurrency trying to make its smart-contract economy flourish, maximizing network effects.

Central banks commonly target a 2 % inflation. A too high inflation will erode real wages and savings, lead to rising tensions between social groups and costly periods of disinflation. Periods of deflation on the other hand are often associated with economic crises and bursting bubbles. As demand falls, companies reduce their workforces. Debtors have a hard time paying back their loans denominated in nominal terms and the subsequent defaults remove liquidity, risking a deflationary spiral. Wages would need to fall each year to keep up, but a downward wage rigidity can be expected. In the absence of workers accepting yearly pay cuts, unemployment may rise further. The fact that people can increase their wealth by hoarding cash is also detrimental to economic activity in periods of deflation. Thus, a 2 % inflation target gives central banks some margins down to 0 % so that they can lower nominal interest rates in recessions to spur economic activity, avoid deflation traps, and reduce unemployment.

The realities of proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies like Ethereum are a little different. Deflation causes a rise in the value of the ETH token, but wages are not denominated in ETH and neither are mortgages. Deflation does not bring potential unemployment or spiraling debt burdens. It is rather a fall in price that can be destabilizing, with cascading liquidations among those that lent out their tokens in return for some other form of value, like stablecoins.

The risks of reduced economic activity due to increased wealth from hoarding cash stands out as the most applicable also for Ethereum (hoarding ETH in this case). Certainly, it is desirable with high economic activity and demand. It brings developers to the ecosystem and helps build the network effects that cement Ethereum as the engine of Web3. But now consider the two most interesting options available to token holders in proof-of-stake Ethereum. They may lock up their tokens by staking them, earning yield, or they may use the tokens for economic activity, interacting with smart contracts. Issuance of new tokens to stakers is the only source of inflation in the system. The higher the yield, the higher the inflationary pressure. The higher the yield, the more desirable to lock up tokens instead of participating in the economy. Thus, the relationship between deflation and economic activity is *reversed* in comparison with the fiat economy.

Stakers are a vital part of the ecosystem and should of course be rewarded for their work. But venturing far away from minimum viable issuance to produce inflation will simply constitute a transfer of wealth from those that participate to those that lock up their tokens. Of course, not all forms of ""participation"" may result in high transaction volume. But the mere fact that capital is available and ready to be deployed is arguably important for enticing smart-contract developers to build. If the staking yield is pushed up to produce inflation, the tough competition from the yield of the staking contract discourages development on the chain. It is perhaps not surprising that innovation and economic activity exploded on Ethereum. The promise of an economically sound proof-of-stake consensus in the future in combination with % 0 yield due to proof of work in the short term is an attractive proposition for developers because it produces a lot of capital willing to invest in their DApps. Higher-than-needed staking yield would also force willing participants into a “money lego” of staking derivates, which brings systematic risks to any ecosystem of DApps dependent on them. In a deflationary Ethereum, people can hold ETH tokens without seeing their savings eroded and use them for transactions whenever needs in their daily life arise.

Naturally, it would be possible to produce inflation without pushing up the staking yield if the issued tokens could fund some other desirable development. The problem is that public goods funding is very tricky and would undoubtedly lead to friction in the community. Ethereum is not all-encompassing in the same way that fiat money is within a country. Participants can leave the Ethereum economy at any time if they perceive that their holdings are diluted for questionable reasons or projects. This is a good thing.

TL;DR: *Inflation* of a fiat currency erodes savings and *deflation* can bankrupt debtors, slow down economic activity, and lead to unemployment. Central banks balance by targeting a 2 % inflation, keeping some margin for lowering nominal interest rates to 0 % in recessions. For Ethereum, the potential issue with deflation is restricted to slower economic activity. Participants have two attractive choices in the proof-of-stake ecosystem, locking up their tokens for staking or participating in the smart-contract economy. Issuance of new tokens to stakers is the only source of inflation in the system. Inflation can thus be produced by increasing the yield, but this will slow down activity, not increase it, since it incentivizes people to lock up their tokens for staking instead of interacting with smart contracts. A deflationary Ethereum where the burn rate is higher than the issuance rate attracts capital and developers that wish to capture that capital. Thus, deflation is economically sound for Ethereum considering its forthcoming proof-of-stake consensus.

\--------------------------------------------------------

From time to time, it is suggested that cryptocurrencies should be inflationary like fiat currencies so that users are motivated to spend their tokens, not just hold them. It is important to understand the difference between a central bank trying to balance the desire for high employment and low steady inflation of its fiat currency system with that of a proof-of-stake cryptocurrency trying to make its smart-contract economy flourish, maximizing network effects.

Central banks commonly target a 2 % inflation. A too high inflation will erode real wages and savings, lead to rising tensions between social groups and costly periods of disinflation. Periods of deflation on the other hand are often associated with economic crises and bursting bubbles. As demand falls, companies reduce their workforces. Debtors have a hard time paying back their loans denominated in nominal terms and the subsequent defaults remove liquidity, risking a deflationary spiral. Wages would need to fall each year to keep up, but a downward wage rigidity can be expected. In the absence of workers accepting yearly pay cuts, unemployment may rise further. The fact that people can increase their wealth by hoarding cash is also detrimental to economic activity in periods of deflation. Thus, a 2 % inflation target gives central banks some margins down to 0 % so that they can lower nominal interest rates in recessions to spur economic activity, avoid deflation traps, and reduce unemployment.

The realities of proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies like Ethereum are a little different. Deflation causes a rise in the value of the ETH token, but wages are not denominated in ETH and neither are mortgages. Deflation does not bring potential unemployment or spiraling debt burdens. It is rather a fall in price that can be destabilizing, with cascading liquidations among those that lent out their tokens in return for some other form of value, like stablecoins.

The risks of reduced economic activity due to increased wealth from hoarding cash stands out as the most applicable also for Ethereum (hoarding ETH in this case). Certainly, it is desirable with high economic activity and demand. It brings developers to the ecosystem and helps build the network effects that cement Ethereum as the engine of Web3. But now consider the two most interesting options available to token holders in proof-of-stake Ethereum. They may lock up their tokens by staking them, earning yield, or they may use the tokens for economic activity, interacting with smart contracts. Issuance of new tokens to stakers is the only source of inflation in the system. The higher the yield, the higher the inflationary pressure. The higher the yield, the more desirable to lock up tokens instead of participating in the economy. Thus, the relationship between deflation and economic activity is *reversed* in comparison with the fiat economy.

Stakers are a vital part of the ecosystem and should of course be rewarded for their work. But venturing far away from minimum viable issuance to produce inflation will simply constitute a transfer of wealth from those that participate to those that lock up their tokens. Of course, not all forms of ""participation"" may result in high transaction volume. But the mere fact that capital is available and ready to be deployed is arguably important for enticing smart-contract developers to build. If the staking yield is pushed up to produce inflation, the tough competition from the yield of the staking contract discourages development on the chain. It is perhaps not surprising that innovation and economic activity exploded on Ethereum. The promise of an economically sound proof-of-stake consensus in the future in combination with % 0 yield due to proof of work in the short term is an attractive proposition for developers because it produces a lot of capital willing to invest in their DApps. Higher-than-needed staking yield would also force willing participants into a “money lego” of staking derivates, which brings systematic risks to any ecosystem of DApps dependent on them. In a deflationary Ethereum, people can hold ETH tokens without seeing their savings eroded and use them for transactions whenever needs in their daily life arise.

Naturally, it would be possible to produce inflation without pushing up the staking yield if the issued tokens could fund some other desirable development. The problem is that public goods funding is very tricky and would undoubtedly lead to friction in the community. Ethereum is not all-encompassing in the same way that fiat money is within a country. Participants can leave the Ethereum economy at any time if they perceive that their holdings are diluted for questionable reasons or projects. This is a good thing. By preserving the value of the token, we attract people to the ecosystem in open competition. Another way to look at this is to recognize that the deflationary pressure comes from high demand for blockspace (via the burn mechanism of EIP-1559) and the inflationary pressure exists to keep the chain secure through issuance. As long as the chain is secure, deflation is a sign of an in-demand protocol.

All 3 of these things have one(well more than one) thing in common. I thought all of them were stupid at one time.

If you're reading this, the first two may seem like blockchain no brainers, while the last one may leave you thinking I only have half a brain.

Give me a chance, though. I've learned that sometimes when I think something is stupid(espcially when I think something is stupid), I need to step back and evaluate the situation from a different perspective.

I can Link that outlook to my biggest [#crypto](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/crypto?__eep__=6&amp;__cft__[0]=AZX-xz39OaWrGp81lmoO4RTo2WxCuRwuNDWmanTr5TRkqqhxlae2rvb5kQDN0BybaXGJjxGoDOh8K2vWfdWPhSiYptQYKsgHLsHqJ40T-YP4ZhQAZglatgqWfNzqNi_E7QFR5xXEjsllPSIiZ0GbYRaq&amp;__tn__=*NK-R) successes.

Bitcoin has to be at the top of the list. It was the first real cryptocurrency to find success and it was the first blockchain.

Before Bitcoin, outside of small circles, no one was really talking about the viability of a decentralized online ledger that could could be used for peer to peer [#cash](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/cash?__eep__=6&amp;__cft__[0]=AZX-xz39OaWrGp81lmoO4RTo2WxCuRwuNDWmanTr5TRkqqhxlae2rvb5kQDN0BybaXGJjxGoDOh8K2vWfdWPhSiYptQYKsgHLsHqJ40T-YP4ZhQAZglatgqWfNzqNi_E7QFR5xXEjsllPSIiZ0GbYRaq&amp;__tn__=*NK-R) transfers.

Bitcoin has literally started a digitial revolution that has spread from the internet to the real world.

It has inspired countries like El Salvador to change what it considers money. Literally bringing new life to an underdeveloped country.

Bitcoin has as also inspired coders like Ethereum developer Vitalik Buterin to take blockchain to a new level.

Vitalik built the Ethereum blockchain to where other developers can build on top of the chain using Smart Contracts.

In simplest terms a smart contract is a binding digital agreement that states ""If event A happens, then event B automatically happens.""

As those events happen the whole sequece is updated on the blockchain aka digital ledger.

In the near future, everything from credit, to loans, to repossessions will take place with Smart Contracts on the blockchain.

On top of all that, Ethereum smart contracts not only paved the way for blockchains like BNB and CRO, but also set the foudations for things like decentralized Finance aka DeFi and Play To Earn gaming.

All of which will change how we operate in the modern world.

Now, Crypto Kitties... How did these dumb cats change the digital world?

Well, Crypto Kitties was the first NFT ever. Not only did the cats pave the path for NFTs, very few people know that it was technically the very P2E game ever.

When I first heard of Digital Art, I thought it was stupid and would never catch on.

At that point, I never considered the added value it could provide to smart contracts.

From an artist stand point, it elimitantes the biggest problem most Artist have which is needing to continually produce and sell new Artwork.

With NFTs, we now know that Artists can have it coded into the smart contract that after every resell, a percetange of the trascaction goes back to the Artist wallet.

Imagine if Picasso still had a percentage of every transaction going back to his family. If he had a NFT, it would be possible.

CryptoKittes inspired all of the current NFTs to an extent and is still more advanced than many of the current Profile Pic projects.

The very first NFT was more than Digital Artwork. It was a Play To Earn game before there was [#P2E](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/p2e?__eep__=6&amp;__cft__[0]=AZX-xz39OaWrGp81lmoO4RTo2WxCuRwuNDWmanTr5TRkqqhxlae2rvb5kQDN0BybaXGJjxGoDOh8K2vWfdWPhSiYptQYKsgHLsHqJ40T-YP4ZhQAZglatgqWfNzqNi_E7QFR5xXEjsllPSIiZ0GbYRaq&amp;__tn__=*NK-R).

The game, breeding cats, is actually a very complex mix of probability and game theory.

It's not mashing together 2 NFTS like most current NFT breeding projects.

Crypto Kitties have four layers of dominant/recessive genes and chances of mutations to create new traits. All of which alter how the new NFT kitten appears.

There are also contract restrictions to keep family members from breeding and cool down times based on # of breeds.

The NFT project Crypto Kitties was truly ahead of it's time. Now we are seeing P2E Games being further developed and NFTs being integrated into our everyday life.

It took about 12 yrs for countries to adpot Bitcoin. I think it will take 1/3 if that time before several countries have an official NFT.  
Bitcoin, Ethereum, and

CryptoKitties have all been hugely influential on not only blockchain, but the world.

All 3 of these things have one(well more than one) thing in common. I thought all of them were stupid at one time.

If you're reading this, the first two may seem like blockchain no brainers, while the last one may leave you thinking I only have half a brain.

Give me a chance, though. I've learned that sometimes when I think something is stupid(espcially when I think something is stupid), I need to step back and evaluate the situation from a different perspective.

I can Link that outlook to my biggest [#crypto](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/crypto?__eep__=6&amp;__cft__[0]=AZX-xz39OaWrGp81lmoO4RTo2WxCuRwuNDWmanTr5TRkqqhxlae2rvb5kQDN0BybaXGJjxGoDOh8K2vWfdWPhSiYptQYKsgHLsHqJ40T-YP4ZhQAZglatgqWfNzqNi_E7QFR5xXEjsllPSIiZ0GbYRaq&amp;__tn__=*NK-R) successes.

Bitcoin has to be at the top of the list. It was the first real cryptocurrency to find success and it was the first blockchain.

Before Bitcoin, outside of small circles, no one was really talking about the viability of a decentralized online ledger that could could be used for peer to peer [#cash](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/cash?__eep__=6&amp;__cft__[0]=AZX-xz39OaWrGp81lmoO4RTo2WxCuRwuNDWmanTr5TRkqqhxlae2rvb5kQDN0BybaXGJjxGoDOh8K2vWfdWPhSiYptQYKsgHLsHqJ40T-YP4ZhQAZglatgqWfNzqNi_E7QFR5xXEjsllPSIiZ0GbYRaq&amp;__tn__=*NK-R) transfers.

Bitcoin has literally started a digitial revolution that has spread from the internet to the real world.

It has inspired countries like El Salvador to change what it considers money. Literally bringing new life to an underdeveloped country.

Bitcoin has as also inspired coders like Ethereum developer Vitalik Buterin to take blockchain to a new level.

Vitalik built the Ethereum blockchain to where other developers can build on top of the chain using Smart Contracts.

In simplest terms a smart contract is a binding digital agreement that states ""If event A happens, then event B automatically happens.""

As those events happen the whole sequece is updated on the blockchain aka digital ledger.

In the near future, everything from credit, to loans, to repossessions will take place with Smart Contracts on the blockchain.

On top of all that, Ethereum smart contracts not only paved the way for blockchains like BNB and CRO, but also set the foudations for things like decentralized Finance aka DeFi and Play To Earn gaming.

All of which will change how we operate in the modern world.

Now, Crypto Kitties... How did these dumb cats change the digital world?

Well, Crypto Kitties was the first NFT ever. Not only did the cats pave the path for NFTs, very few people know that it was technically the very P2E game ever.

When I first heard of Digital Art, I thought it was stupid and would never catch on.

At that point, I never considered the added value it could provide to smart contracts.

From an artist stand point, it elimitantes the biggest problem most Artist have which is needing to continually produce and sell new Artwork.

With NFTs, we now know that Artists can have it coded into the smart contract that after every resell, a percetange of the trascaction goes back to the Artist wallet.

Imagine if Picasso still had a percentage of every transaction going back to his family. If he had a NFT, it would be possible.

CryptoKittes inspired all of the current NFTs to an extent and is still more advanced than many of the current Profile Pic projects.

The very first NFT was more than Digital Artwork. It was a Play To Earn game before there was [#P2E](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/p2e?__eep__=6&amp;__cft__[0]=AZX-xz39OaWrGp81lmoO4RTo2WxCuRwuNDWmanTr5TRkqqhxlae2rvb5kQDN0BybaXGJjxGoDOh8K2vWfdWPhSiYptQYKsgHLsHqJ40T-YP4ZhQAZglatgqWfNzqNi_E7QFR5xXEjsllPSIiZ0GbYRaq&amp;__tn__=*NK-R).

The game, breeding cats, is actually a very complex mix of probability and game theory.

It's not mashing together 2 NFTS like most current NFT breeding projects.

Crypto Kitties have four layers of dominant/recessive genes and chances of mutations to create new traits. All of which alter how the new NFT kitten appears.

There are also contract restrictions to keep family members from breeding and cool down times based on # of breeds.

The NFT project Crypto Kitties was truly ahead of it's time. Now we are seeing P2E Games being further developed and NFTs being integrated into our everyday life.

It took about 12 yrs for countries to adpot Bitcoin. I think it will take 1/3 if that time before several countries have an official NFT.  
Bitcoin, Ethereum, and

CryptoKitties have all been hugely influential on not only blockchain, but the world.

I get it, gas helps the blockchain validate transactions, and yes, whoever is running the nodes needs to get paid. But are those nodes really worth you paying the equivalent of 20 Starbucks Pumpkin Spice lattes to swap two shitcoins? I think not.

Even more disrespectful is when Metamask shows you the option to pay low, medium, high gas fees. First, the “low” gas fee still costs at least 10 Pumpkin spice lattes. Second, even if you pay “high” gas the transaction still takes longer than you driving to the local coffee shop, waiting in line, buying the Pumpkin Spice with Oat Milk and Stevia, chatting with the Barista, and getting your order. This is a total power “get in line” move that Ethereum pulls on everyone of us.

Let’s talk about all the hard-working people who are trying to make one-click checkout happen in the face of the mafia, government conspiracy, and fast-growing T-shirt companies. The fact that Ethereum takes 10 min+ to process each transaction AND charges $100+ in gas is an insult in the face of all of these hard working employees who are fighting the good fight.

So look, I totally get that you think Ethereum is the world’s decentralized computer and blah blah blah. But we have suffered this naked one-sided relationship for far too long. It’s high time that we demand the following:

1. Easier L2 onramps that doesn’t require $100+ bridge fee
2. A better way to reduce gas other than Ethereum prices dropping in half

I just wanna ask some questions on ethereum proof of stake mechanism. So, I understand that there are validators which validate transactions, and that you need to stake some amount of coin to become validator. More coin you stake, more validating transaction and more fee you will get. If you don't validate transactions fairly, you can be ,,punished,, by taking some part of your staked amount of coints, or even everything you staked. Now, the questions are:

&amp;#x200B;

1. How exactly validators validate the transactions? It's not that they are sitting at their pc pressing yes and no button?
2. How can someone cheat and validate corrupted transaction?
3. If someone stakes on pool, and validate not valid transaction, does the whole pool takes damage?

Matt has been able to quickly establish himself as one of the premier crypto and NFT investors with his advanced technical analysis to analyze the bearish or bullish movements of top performing crypto coins and tokens. While many traditional investors focus on spammy videos and forums to identify the desired crypto and NFTs, Matt has taken a different approach. 

He shares that “I like to focus on building a reputation, direction, credibility, and appeal first for crypto and NFTs.

I'm happy to elaborate on any of them, but please keep the discussion in good faith. I'm also willing to add more points if I forgot some. Some of these are my own opinion, some definitely require more context to understand properly (again, happy to elaborate) but the goal is to quickly summarize all the different stuff that gets brought up over and over.

Anyway yeah, if you're invested in Ethereum, or at the very least interested in it enough to be browsing this sub (why else would you be here lol) then you should be aware of the following:

1. Ethereum is the network, Ether is the currency. And there is no ""I"" anywhere in the name.

2. [Fees are high](https://cryptofees.info/) because that's how much the market values Ethereum's limited blockspace. It's purely supply and demand.
    * Fees scale with [how much computation is being executed](https://docs.ethhub.io/using-ethereum/transactions/), not how much money is being handled. It costs $5 on average to send any amount of Ether, whether it's $1's worth or $1 million's. It costs much more to do swaps and mint NFTs and such because those operations require more computation.
    * There is no way for anyone to artificially keep fees high unless they're willing to [literally burn millions of dollars per day for no reason](https://watchtheburn.com/).

3. Ethereum's blockspace is limited because letting people run nodes themselves on average consumer hardware is important for decentralization.
    * Decentralization is a spectrum and has many meanings from protocol specification, protocol implementation, node distribution, coin distribution, censorship resistance, permissionlessness, etc.
    * Pointing at one aspect to scream ""centralized"" isn't clever nor helpful. Chances are the aspect you point out is known and is an active area of research with a concrete plan on [the roadmap](https://i.imgur.com/vXMaIyZ.png) to address it and increase decentralization some more.
    * No blockchain is ever fully decentralized, especially not from the start – and Ethereum's end goal is to be able to run without a hiccup for *decades* if not *centuries*. At 6.5 years old, it's still very young.
    * If you care about decentralization, invest in and contribute to projects like Ethereum who view it as a goal, not a crutch that ""nobody cares about it that much anyway, let's just [increase the gas limit](https://github.com/binance-chain/bsc/issues/553) to have low fees asap""

4. There is a [vast difference](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/#node-types) between an ""archive node"" (several TBs) and a ""full node"" (hundreds of GBs)
    * Running an archive node is not necessary to sync from genesis and verify blocks and transactions.
    * A full node has all the information enough to generate an archive node.
    * There are plans on [the roadmap](https://i.imgur.com/vXMaIyZ.png) to reduce the storage/bandwidth/RAM requirements of nodes even more, to a point where a smartphone will be able to independently verify and propagate new blocks. 

5. There is no ""when eth2 rolls out"" or ""when devs release eth2"" or god forbid ""when ethereum is upgraded to 2.0"". What there is instead is a roadmap consisting of a series of upgrades aiming to help rollups – *not the base layer* – scale to hundreds of thousands of TPS.
    * Depending on context, Eth1 is usually synonymous with ""execution layer"" and Eth2 usually means ""consensus layers"" ([helpful illustration](https://i.imgur.com/AHHcUgm.png)) otherwise ""eth2"" is an umbrella term for the set of upgrades over a long period of time, but the fact remains that there is no specific instant in time where ""eth1 turns into eth2"".
    * Similarly, there is no ""eth2"" coin. ETH is ETH, you don't have to do anything, the coins you hold today will be the same after the switch to proof of stake.

6. Unlocking staked Ether [will not cause a mass sell-off event](https://twitter.com/domothy/status/1467387422765953029). There is a limited withdrawing queue, it's not gonna happen all at once. And there are many more reasons for more people to start staking Ether than there are for the current stakers to exit en masse.
    * Also, unlocking staked Ether will not be possible directly after the merge. Withdrawals will be enable in the first fork that follows the merge ~6 months later.

7. There are plenty of options to avoid high gas fees, it's perfectly fine to use a sidechain to do your DeFi stuff for now. I use sidechains myself too. Just don't pretend these sidechains will replace Ethereum in any significant way as that's not even what they're trying to do.

8. Switching to Proof of Stake [will not lower Layer 1 gas fees significantly](https://willthemergelowergasprices.org/). Anyone saying otherwise is either misinformed or trying to mislead you into false expectations to bank on the inevitable mass disappointment following the merge.
    * It's still a monumental upgrade that will render possible much-needed upgrades like light clients, statelessness, and sharding, etc. that would otherwise be impossible or impractical to implement on the current proof of work chain.
    * It's basically a way to ""start from scratch"" while keeping the same coin, same users, same dapps, same network effects.
    * PoS has been on the roadmap [since day 1](https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/03/03/ethereum-launch-process/). Yes, estimates of PoS dates have been wrong before. However right now it's all hands on deck on the merge, the spec is done, the beacon chain is running, there is a [merge testnet running](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/12/20/kintsugi-merge-testnet/), it's happening.

9. Sharding will not lower Layer 1 gas fees significantly either. Sharding is all about *data*, execution on Layer 1 will still be limited and expensive. What data sharding will do is help rollups (Layer 2) scale by several orders of magnitude.

10. [Rollups](https://mirror.xyz/ethmaxitard.eth/iyCAlOexgQKOvoSAAk4utYGEdnESOKb5HstM2_LaqL4) are [already live today](https://l2beat.com/) and they will only [get cheaper](https://l2fees.info/) as more people use them.

11. [Data sharding + rollups is the only sustainable way](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/pk57n7/why_rollups_data_shards_are_the_only_sustainable/) to scale a blockchain globally without compromising decentralization.
    * ""Sustainable"" as in the overall security model doesn't rely on hoping that the coin's price will pump forever to outpace the dilution from the blockchain issuing way more new coins than they collect in fees. Something that all major blockchains (including Ethereum most days, and even Bitcoin) are currently doing.
    * ""Without compromising decentralization"" as in more decentralization = more data for rollups = more scaling (lower individual fees on L2). Decentralization becomes an integral part of the scaling equation rather than a crutch.
    * [The rollup-centric roadmap](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-rollup-centric-ethereum-roadmap/4698) is all about admitting that no single blockchain can do it all by itself and can't compete with what rollups can do. In other words, ""Ethereum maximalism"" amounts to helping independent teams develop rollups, innovate and compete with each other on top of Ethereum's secure, decentralized, and open platform.
    * The true competition of sidechains is rollups, not Ethereum itself. 
    * All the criticisms of a multi-rollup world apply to the current multi-chain world model as well. Except they apply way more to the multi-chain world and can be overcome way more easily in a multi-rollup world.
    * A rollup can settle on any L1, sure, but it's gonna gravitate towards the most secure, most decentralized and most credibly neutral settlement layer with the best data availability. Right now only Bitcoin and Ethereum fit those criteria (other L1s optimize for fast execution, not secure data availability) and Bitcoin would need a hard fork to implement rollup-friendly functions, so that only leaves Ethereum as the poised [""AWS for blockchain""](https://twitter.com/domothy/status/1465905887541972996).

12. Ether isn't meant to be a day-to-day currency that will replace fiat. The use-case of Ether isn't to pay for bread and milk, it's to pay for gas fees and secure the network. All the other use-cases derive from Ether's scarcity, but they're not strictly necessary.
    * Having Ether be an appreciating asset is good for the overall long-term health of the network by providing it with more [economic security, its holders more economic bandwidth](https://i.imgur.com/AErfdod.png), and its users more reasons to hold/stake. The incoming deflation is good.
    * However, the supply is not gonna be deflationary forever. The market dictates how much the blockspace is worth (so how much gets burned) and it also dictates how much the staking APR should be (so how much gets printed) so these two opposing forces will meet in the middle at some point. It's all about [them feedback loops](https://i.imgur.com/3bPV35a.png).

13. The security model trumps the economic model. The core idea behind the economic model is, has always been, and will always be: ""[Minimum viable issuance to secure the network](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/izhkvk/minimum_viable_issuance_why_ethereums_lack_of_a/)"".

14. It's okay to change or tweak things when new research indicates there's a problem with long-term sustainability or security of the current model. These changes don't happen ""on a whim of a few people"", there's a lot of consideration that go into them.
    * And remember, changes happen in a highly adversarial context. If there's *any* possibility of an upgrade causing security problems or being exploited in any way for profit, then it *will* happen. Changes don't just happen for fun ""just because"", they happen when their benefits outweigh the inherent risks of potentially adding more complexity.

15. The Ethereum Foundation is more of a [coordinator than a dictator](https://ethereum.foundation/philosophy/). It's much more of a community-focused bottom-up approach than the top-down structure people think.
    * Everything happens extremely transparently on open forums that no one reads and [public livestream calls](https://www.youtube.com/c/EthereumFoundation/videos) that no one listens to. But everyone who wants to participate is welcome, it's all out in the open.
    * The Ethereum Foundation doesn't code any of the actual software, client teams do. There are 5 major execution clients and 4 major consensus clients, developed by independent teams, to implement the protocol specification. This multi-client approach may be responsible for development delays, but it comes with [security benefits](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/mreacw/psa_the_importance_of_multiclient_and_why_the/)
    * [Anyone can propose an Ethereum Improvement Proposal](https://ethereum.org/en/eips/). You just have to convince others it's a good idea to implement it (most EIPs don't get implemented and fall into obscurity) and the clients could just refuse to code it in if it's a very bad idea. The more time passes, the harder it becomes to push changes to the Ethereum protocol and everything converges to the status quo. (This doesn't close the door to further innovation however, as it's still an open platform on which anyone can build)
    * Vitalik regularly gets his proposals blocked by client teams, other researchers, or the community in general. At most, he's a knowledgeable influence because he knows the tech and cryptography in depth and has been there from the beginning. It's silly to worship him, and it's silly to treat him as Ethereum's Zucc-like CEO. He's ""just some guy"".

16. The ""[DAO hard fork](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-779)"" wasn't a roll-back. Not a single transaction was reverted, no one lost any funds other than the exploiter who could have otherwise gotten away with [15% of the total supply at the time](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/2016/06/25/understanding-the-dao-attack/). It wasn't a bailout of Vitalik and his pals, it was a bailout of a huge chunk of the community from an event that could have killed the whole thing in its infancy. 
    * In the end it's all social consensus, and the consensus from miners, users, developers was strong. Even ""code is law"" is social consensus that [can get reverted in case of major bugs](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Value_overflow_incident). It's all about what the community deems [legitimate](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html).

17. As far as the [initial distribution](https://i.imgur.com/k3GB8Lh.png) goes, Ethereum's ICO is among [the best of those who had an ICO](https://i.imgur.com/fmW3ytf.png), and as far as the current distribution goes (after 6 years of proof of work and market movements), it's [on par with Bitcoin's](https://medium.com/@adamscochran/the-10k-audit-42c100dd32bb). 60m of the 72m ""pre-mined"" coins went to a permissionless no-KYC sale, and [all the genesis transactions are included in Block #0](https://etherscan.io/txs?block=0) so you can check yourself that there's no hidden coins. Just like Bitcoin, early investors took on big risks and got big rewards. No surprises here. Any concerns of the ICO being a scam or rugpull should have vanished some time in 2015, yet here we are still talking about it for some reason.
    * And if coin distribution is a concern to you because proof of stake, then you should be glad the DAO hack didn't end up with a single person owning 15% of the supply...

18. There is no ""technical debt"" preventing Ethereum from scaling.

19. EIP-1559 was [not meant to lower gas fees](https://web.archive.org/web/20210205013340/https://willeip1559lowergasprices.org/) and no credible person ever promised it was a scaling solution.
    * It has [many benefits](https://domothy.com/eip1559/) beyond coin burning. The deflation is a nice side effect, and it's certainly not a gimmick meant to pump the price.

20. Proof of Work is really just Proof of Stake with extra steps.
    * In both systems, the goal is reach consensus in a sybil-resistant way. Spending time and energy by computing hashes over and over is just the easiest way to reach that goal. But if we can achieve that goal (randomness + verifiable delay functions) without using the energy of a continent, maybe we should look into it.
    * In both systems, whoever has capital gets to earn more capital by producing more blocks. (Except in Proof of Stake, everyone earns at the same rate, proportional to how much they stake)
    * In both systems, the capital that someone has at stake (mining rigs vs coins directly) is a good indicative that they will play by the rules.
    * By design, [Ethereum doesn't have on-chain governance](https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-basics/governance/#on-chain-governance). This means that the people with the most coins can't change the rules under PoS any more than the people with the most hash rate can change the rules under PoW.
    * Just like there are mining pools, there are staking pools. As usual, some options are [more decentralized and community-focused](https://rocketpool.net/) than others.",-0.9841092228889464,0.1664294770780126,0.4807737427611902,0.113,0.063,0.823,0.9992

It wasn't a bailout of Vitalik and his pals, it was a bailout of a huge chunk of the community from an event that could have killed the whole thing in its infancy. 
    * In the end it's all social consensus, and the consensus from miners, users, developers was strong. Even ""code is law"" is social consensus that [can get reverted in case of major bugs](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Value_overflow_incident). It's all about what the community deems [legitimate](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html).

17. As far as the [initial distribution](https://i.imgur.com/k3GB8Lh.png) goes, Ethereum's ICO is among [the best of those who had an ICO](https://i.imgur.com/fmW3ytf.png), and as far as the current distribution goes (after 6 years of proof of work and market movements), it's [on par with Bitcoin's](https://medium.com/@adamscochran/the-10k-audit-42c100dd32bb). 60m of the 72m ""pre-mined"" coins went to a permissionless no-KYC sale, and [all the genesis transactions are included in Block #0](https://etherscan.io/txs?block=0) so you can check yourself that there's no hidden coins. Just like Bitcoin, early investors took on big risks and got big rewards. No surprises here. Any concerns of the ICO being a scam or rugpull should have vanished some time in 2015, yet here we are still talking about it for some reason.
    * And if coin distribution is a concern to you because proof of stake, then you should be glad the DAO hack didn't end up with a single person owning 15% of the supply...

18. There is no ""technical debt"" preventing Ethereum from scaling.

19. EIP-1559 was [not meant to lower gas fees](https://web.archive.org/web/20210205013340/https://willeip1559lowergasprices.org/) and no credible person ever promised it was a scaling solution.
    * It has [many benefits](https://domothy.com/eip1559/) beyond coin burning. The deflation is a nice side effect, and it's certainly not a gimmick meant to pump the price.

20. Proof of Work is really just Proof of Stake with extra steps.
    * In both systems, the goal is reach consensus in a sybil-resistant way. Spending time and energy by computing hashes over and over is just the easiest way to reach that goal. But if we can achieve that goal (randomness + verifiable delay functions) without using the energy of a continent, maybe we should look into it.
    * In both systems, whoever has capital gets to earn more capital by producing more blocks. (Except in Proof of Stake, everyone earns at the same rate, proportional to how much they stake)
    * In both systems, the capital that someone has at stake (mining rigs vs coins directly) is a good indicative that they will play by the rules.
    * By design, [Ethereum doesn't have on-chain governance](https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-basics/governance/#on-chain-governance). This means that the people with the most coins can't change the rules under PoS any more than the people with the most hash rate can change the rules under PoW.
    * Just like there are mining pools, there are staking pools. As usual, some options are [more decentralized and community-focused](https://rocketpool.net/) than others.",-0.9841092228889464,0.1664294770780126,0.4807737427611902,0.113,0.063,0.823,0.9992

Please, before anyone calls me a scammer, just know that I put my heart and soul into this project. It can be quite hurtful to say that to someone who has been working for the past 12+ months for free and spend all his money on this project. But most importantly, we have all the evidence to show you that we are not, so bear with me.

So over a year ago, I decided to build my own DeFi application called CryptoHelp.  I had made some money with my crypto investments (and also lost a lot, haha) but now I wanted to take it to the next level. During a summer holiday, a friend and I coded our own first decentralized application on Ethereum (Solidity and React). This gave me a lot of experience and confidence to build the next project called CryptoHelp. Moreover, I had years of experience doing research in Blockchain since I already had gone into Bitcoin at the age of 15.

In the beginning, it went great. I found a team and we made a lot of progress quite fast and even though we had some hiccups, it went pretty smooth. Even though I was paying the devs 2-3x my own salary, more than I ever made (not complaining, they are worth it).  I was confident that we could get investors for the next phase. After all, we had a working application on Testnet, it wasn't perfect, but after 12+ months of hard work, we certainly had something presentable (just google 'CryptoHelp' to see and try it yourself). At least we are not some kind of project with just a whitepaper asking for money (which I absolutely hate). I funded everything myself first, to take the most risk out of the project for investors.

But unfortunately, this is not really how the world works it appears to me. Because most investors don't even look at what we have built and try. They mostly look at the Pitch Deck, Business Plan, Whitepaper for a couple of minutes and are on to the next. I get it, they get so many requests each day. We have a Pitch Deck and all but I am a builder, not a fundraising person. Moreover, I definitely made the mistake of not focusing on going to Mainnet sooner. Instead, I just focused on adding more features to make a better application before going on Mainnet. 

So please, anyone who can help us in any shape or form, let me know. I still wholeheartedly believe in this project. I spent all my money on CryptoHelp. Also, already moving in with my mom in two weeks because I can't afford the rent anymore. I can't let this go, it is literally everything that I got. So now I am setting aside my pride and I am asking the Ethereum community for help.

It is a bit out of date (it's from May 2020) and doesn't mention roll ups at all.   


I've summarized it from this podcast readthrough from [Ethereum Audible](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2c9XDQZBx88nRMud5BoNzK?si=d4uHuv6PT3O6mM-ffRF7oQ), would love to hear thoughts on how up to date this still is.

### The basics of the beacon chain

Ethereum 2.0 is made up of two core aspects:

1. Proof of stake consensus
2. Sharding

While this primer is slightly outdated and missing the rollup centric roadmap for Ethereum it gives a great overview of the other two key aspects.

### Beacon chain PoS

The Ethereum PoS is broken down into block slots and Epochs. Each block slot is several seconds long in which a validator is given the role of being a block proposer. Every 32 block slots compose one epoch. Finality of blocks occurs at the end of epochs.

The structure is as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

* Each slot is 12 seconds
* An epoch is \~6.4 minutes
* Each block is verified and each slot epoch must receive 2/3 majority to be accepted as a legitimate checkpoint
* Once a checkpoint has been accepted it is ‘*justified*’ once the following checkpoint that links to it has been justified, the previously justified checkpoint becomes *finalized*.
* Finalization takes an average of 2.5 epochs = 14 minutes.

### Sharding

One of the Beacon chains main roles is to coordinate shards. Sharding is a technique in database management. To grow a database you can either scale horizontally or vertically.

* Horizontal scaling means adding more power to each node.
* Vertical scaling means adding more nodes.

Sharding is a method of vertical scaling. While the current plans for Ethereum include 64 shards, it is clear as of the beginning of 2022 that at first there will be much fewer shards and they will not be complete Ethereum replicas, rather data storage ones.",-0.8270009160041809,0.1706196581196581,0.4748931623931624,0.084,0.057,0.859,0.9027

I live in Argentina and my grandparents want to sell their house, the economic situation of the country is not very good so that everyone is constantly bidding to buy a house. Since the pandemic began, the situation in the country worsened and the working sector of our society was strongly affected. The value of our currency decreased in large percentages and the government established taxes to be able to exchange the currency for a stronger one which adds a great difficulty to be able to cope with the situation.

Many chose to sell their belongings and leave the country, which increased the number of homes for sale. So far sales of houses in cryptocurrencies were made to avoid taxes only and you can count on the fingers of your hands the number of times this was done.

My idea is what I raise in the title of this post. Register all the papers in a blockchain, make the registration legally according to how determined by the Argentine Government and carry out the exchange of the house and documents in physical and their documents also in an NFT format.

I would like to receive some tips so that I do not forget that I must register and also, that they share this in some way to find many more opinions, if you also have tips of where it is better to put this in an auction.

The price of the house is estimated at 265,000 USD, so that while this is not done they can make the account and equate the price in BTC.

It is a two-story house, with patio, and has two garages, one of them roofed. Located in the 3rd most important city in the country in a residential area, the neighborhood is quiet.

I live in Argentina and my grandparents want to sell their house, the economic situation of the country is not very good so that everyone is constantly bidding to buy a house. Since the pandemic began, the situation in the country worsened and the working sector of our society was strongly affected. The value of our currency decreased in large percentages and the government established taxes to be able to exchange the currency for a stronger one which adds a great difficulty to be able to cope with the situation.

Many chose to sell their belongings and leave the country, which increased the number of homes for sale. So far sales of houses in cryptocurrencies were made to avoid taxes only and you can count on the fingers of your hands the number of times this was done.

My idea is what I raise in the title of this post. Register all the papers in a blockchain, make the registration legally according to how determined by the Argentine Government and carry out the exchange of the house and documents in physical and their documents also in an NFT format.

\+ Investing for the long term is one of the best ways to build wealth.

\+ While crypto is still speculative, some investments have the potential for long-term growth.

\+ By holding your investments for as long as possible, you can maximize your earnings.

Although 2021 may have been the year that cryptocurrency went mainstream, 2022 looks even more promising for some of the biggest names in crypto, like Ethereum.

Crypto can be an intimidating investment, as some cryptocurrencies see explosive growth only to plummet essentially overnight. Investing isn't a get-rich-quick tactic, however. If you want to maximize your earnings, it's best to buy solid cryptocurrencies and hold them for as long as possible.

Not all cryptocurrencies are created equal, so it's crucial to make sure you're investing in the right places. One such cryptocurrency with long-term price appreciation is Ethereum. It has real-world utility and the potential for long-term growth, making them smart buy-and-hold investments.

Ethereum (CRYPTO:ETH) is one of the strongest players in the crypto market right now. Not only can its native token, Ether, be used as a form of payment, but the Ethereum blockchain itself is home to a wide variety of decentralized applications (dApps).

These dApps include projects such as decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces, and they could potentially revolutionize a variety of industries. Also, because the network is open-source, developers around the world can create new projects on Ethereum. This creates nearly unlimited potential for growth.

The biggest hurdle Ethereum is facing right now is its speed (or lack thereof). It's currently one of the slowest cryptocurrencies out there, with a transaction speed of around 15 transactions per second. (For reference, Visa can reportedly process up to 24,000 transactions per second.)

However, Ethereum is currently in the process of updating its network. According to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, once Ethereum 2.0 rolls out sometime this year, it could potentially handle up to 100,000 transactions per second. With that kind of speed in addition to its powerful blockchain, Ethereum could be a force to be reckoned with in the coming years.

It might be a little dumb but I only really understand trading crypto and not really the behind the scenes stuff. 

How does Ethereum make money? All the people that work on Ethereum must get paid so where does that money come from?

I understand coins are created through mining so that basically means that the coins are essentially given out for free to miners and then the miners sell them to stimulate the crypto economy?
