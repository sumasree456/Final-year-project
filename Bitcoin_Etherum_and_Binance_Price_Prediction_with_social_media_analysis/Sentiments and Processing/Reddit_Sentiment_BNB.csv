2022-01-01 00:04:39,"Transferring ADA back to Binance from Binance Direct Wallet Hello guys,

Recently, I transferred my ADA coins to my Binance Direct Wallet without researching too much (I know, my bad!). Now, I would like to transfer it back to the Binance platform for trading, however it asks to pay the fees as BNB (it's around 0.000383 BNB). I tried to swap some of my ADA's into BNB, however, for that it still requires BNB (strange). Every fee somehow is limited to BNB. Now, it's kind of stuck in my Wallet (I use Binance Wallet's Chrome extension).

Is there any other way (rather than buying some BNB) to transfer back my ADA's?",-0.9999899864196777,-0.010119047619047602,0.2903769841269841,0.021,0.094,0.885,-0.7707

2022-01-01 03:52:28,"Would Anyone Like to See Me Sue Binance U.S. on Live Television?  

Title, Judge Judy style.

For a little bit of context, I filed a lawsuit against BAM TRADING SERVICES INC. aka Binance U.S. in the court of San Francisco, CA, small claims division.

I was a customer of the original Binance website, and couldn't get my account or bank account verified with Binance U.S. for over 9 months, and it magically only became verified just as the bull run ended this year. I contacted customer service \*many\* times, many times.

When I contacted customer service, I would receive no reply for weeks at a time. I found notices finally that said they were backlogged and 'doing their best,' but they were still taking new customers, this button never disappeared despite the backlog claim. Binance U.S. took all my information, promised me the basic ability to buy, sell, and trade crypto, and held my account until the coins I would purchase were at maximum cost. I relied on Binance U.S. to verify my account in a timely fashion once they took all my sensitive personal information, my social security number, my bank account routing, account, and balance numbers. My address. My phone number.

I imagine the only counter argument is 'you could have gone to a different exchange.' Each time I received notice from Binance, they assured me it was temporary, and honestly, am I supposed to just spam all these details all over the internet in \*the hope\* that one of the parties receiving it is honest about their offereing? I don't see how any of this is in good faith, so I filed a lawsuit for the losses. I have a lot of documentation proving even the specific cryptocurrency I was trying to purchase as well.

When I contacted Binance parent company a couple times, I got an instant same day response, just like you would expect from the world's largest cryptocurrency market. They know this is a reasonable expectation. I read a lot that Binance U.S. is just a regulatory cover to keep the real activity on Binance. I'm not rich, I'm not deep into the market, I just wanted to buy a reasonable amount of cryptocurrency after the election ended. I saw someone else post about how Binance did the exact same thing to them, and how they literally cried at the loss, and I decided I would file my lawsuit.

The lawsuit was very easy to file. I looked up Binance U.S.' business records, starting with the info from their website. I found BAM TRADING SERVICES INC with the secretary of state(every state has some kind of collection of records of corporations doing business inside of them), I filled out all the required paperwork, and asked the court to serve the papers. I am indigent, so it cost literally nothing. Yes, you can file a lawsuit over something like this without spending a penny if you are poor. Do the reading, we should all know how to do it.

So today, I got a text today from a producer at the television show 'Hot Bench' in Los Angeles, CA. They've asked if I would like to litigate my case on their show. I could sue Binance U.S on live television, and everyone in the crypto community could watch.

What do you think?

P.S. - For the record, I'm clearly a big fan of crypto, I wanted to buy in at what I think is a terrific safe time: after the election when everyone remembers the current system is dogshit and starts buying out. This isn't an attack on crypto, I just want these people to play fair with us if they are going to become disgustingly rich along the way.",-0.9999532699584961,0.1836770140428677,0.5667775314116777,0.131,0.063,0.806,0.9936

I recently send USDT from a Binance Smart Chain network in my MetaMask wallet to my Coinbase Wallet. When it didn't show up, I realized I had made a mistake; however, when I switch the CB Wallet network over to Binance Smart Chain, the USDT appears. After a bit of research, I now realize that when I originally converted BNB to USDT, it did not occur cross-chain, and the USDT I received was BEP-20.

In order to send the USDT(BEP-20) out of CoinBase Wallet, it is requiring ETH for the transaction fee. Being that I am attempting the transfer from the Binance Smart Chain network, I cannot put ETH onto the network to use as a Txn fee. I tried sending ETH, but it went to the ETH network instead. I also tried sending ETH (BEP20), but it never showed up.

Any ideas about what I can do to get the USDT (BEP20) off the BSC network? Ultimately, I want to convert it to ETH. Thank you.",-0.9999551773071289,0.17602040816326528,0.6530612244897959,0.067,0.009,0.924,0.8126

2022-01-04 18:29:55,"Probability of losing your money if you keep it on Binance Please don't attack my ignorance. I am asking a serious question.

Many people in the crypto world recommend to move your assets to cold wallets. I understand how that is done and why.

But it's much more productive for trading, and easier for day to day life, to keep my assets in the Binance spot wallet.

Actually, I am thinking to move most of my money into Binance. Inflation is killing my Fiat anyway.

But I wonder if this is really as risky as people say. I don't see the chance of Binance getting hacked bigger than the chance of my actual Bank getting hacked. Binance makes so much money that they probably have a level of security that touches the sky. And as long as I keep my 2FA and don't fall into phishing traps, I will be fine.

The only potential issue I see is, a normal Bank is more regulated and I have the guarantee that a certain amount of my money will be recovered even if the Bank disappears. With Binance, if it disappears... I guess I will lose everything.

But... does such a chance exist at all? Is it greater than the chance of the whole society collapsing anyway?",-0.9997908473014832,0.1448809523809524,0.5144047619047619,0.137,0.13,0.733,-0.5797

My first post here on not such a pleasant topic. I am owed several refunds for a transactions worth thousands of EUR from my Binance VISA debit card. Two of the refunds are from more than 30 working days. I contacted Binance Customer Service on several occasions during the period only to be told the same thing over and over: ""Please be patient and give us some more time."" ""We understand your problem and are passing your inquiry to the relevant department. Wait 12-24 hours"" Then nobody follows up.

There is no resolution of the problem, with every new chat I have to explain the same things to different people. Really disappointed in the handling of the refunds and I am now beginning to think that I might lose a substantial amount of money.

The refunds were made by PayPal / eBay and they complete their refunds to a bank issued credit card in 3-5 days always. I don't understand what is causing this massive delay on Binance end. Has anyone had a similar issue? I am at a loss.

There’s also a dedicated binance chain wallet, 

[https://docs.binance.org/smart-chain/wallet/binance.html](https://docs.binance.org/smart-chain/wallet/binance.html)

With easier integration to your binance account though it doesn’t yet have a mobile app version, so if you plan to interact mostly from your phone,  stick to Metamask. Both wallets let’s you interact with smart contracts in the blockchain via frontend websites called Dapps/WEB3.0. You can do a lot of things in those Dapps like making bets, trading,  saving/lending , staking and providing liquidity.

**Providing Liquidity in DeFI**

In a DeFI Decentralized Exchange (DEX) like Ethereum’s Uniswap or their BSC counterpart, Pancakeswap,  there are no order books instead every trade you make happens against a liquidity pool provided by liquidity providers (LP). The mechanism is called Automated Market Makers (AMM), in which liquidity providers stake an equal value of paired tokens, ETH-USDT for example, and in return for facilitating trade receives a LP/Flip token and \~ 0.17-0.25%  of the trade volume that occurs in that pool. 

[https://finematics.com/liquidity-pools-explained/](https://finematics.com/liquidity-pools-explained/)

**Introducing Binance Smart Chain (BSC), the 2nd most popular destination for LPs**

As Ethereum gas fees (the cost to make a transaction in the blockchain) has risen to hundreds of dollars per Tx, it has driven a lot of retail investors to BSC. BSC currently holds the top position in number of transactions per day and wins in ease of use due to the smooth integration of it’s bsc wallet with binance.com. Being  a much younger ecosystem compared to ETH there are still plenty of opportunities in BSC to get high passive income returns measured in annualized percentage yield (APY) however the low barrier to entry has also made it into a  “rug pull central” of sorts for scam coins and projects. 

**How to tell if a BSC DeFI project is a scam/Ponzi** 

Ok this is important to know before you go diving into BSC and it’s not only about all the dog and moon coins out there but plenty of other projects that looks very formal and solid but is actually a Ponzi/scam.  Technically speaking, A Ponzi scheme is **an investment fraud that pays existing investors with funds collected from new investors**.  In my view, in general, a coin or a Dapp needs to provide some other functions besides playing tricks with liquidity to not be considered as a Ponzi. For example, Pancakeswap facilitates coin trading in BSC, Venus provides crypto savings/lending and Chromia is a SaaS for games. You can tell those are not Ponzi as they provide actual utility while the Ponzi ones usually starts with a variation of the following statement

*“Why is bitcoin considered to not be a Ponzi …. “*

Then will go on to explain why similar to bitcoin,  their coin/project is also not a Ponzi  due to the belief from a large group of people and some convoluted explanation on how their advanced algorithm maintains liquidity. Of course it usually has some crazy high APYs like 1,000,000% for staking and  do a lot of rebasing. Rebasing is the practice of reducing and or increasing the supply of a token, including the ones already in your wallet to achieve a certain price target. So for the token creators to let’s say increase the price by 1,000%, rather then buying the tokens in the liquidity pools he could just reduce the supply by 90%. Obviously in this process no real value is created as it’s just a liquidity shell game which would have to collapse at some point. 

**Nonetheless there are plenty of genuine gems in BSC**

**Like Pancakeswap (PCS) for example,** they are the leading DEX in BSC and have surpassed Uniswap in both transaction count and volume since a few months ago.  PCS provides farming rewards for liquidity providers which means in addition to receiving LP fees from the trading pool, Liquidity Providers can also stake the LP tokens in PCS farms to receive rewards in CAKE token. This reward is often more lucrative then the trading fees it self as it can reach hundreds of percent APY depending on the amount of liquidity in the pool.  A popular LP pair for investors in PCS is the CAKE-BNB pair which earns great rewards while not being too volatile. 

**Calculating**  **Liquidity Providing Profit in Pancakeswap**

You can use a google sheet I created to model Pool value and profit vs  changes in the underlying token prices. , 

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h0uzbnpO7SP1mPw3tj2w-CJ2wKsx7P4DCHgKflgJWoY/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h0uzbnpO7SP1mPw3tj2w-CJ2wKsx7P4DCHgKflgJWoY/edit?usp=sharing)

So for example, to model the BNB-BUSD liquidity pair, from PCS analytics info we know that the LP fees ,the estimated transaction fees APR this pool will receive,  is about 15%  and the farming rewards is 20%. From Binance website we see that if you stake BNB you’ll earn about \~9-10% a year and for BUSD it’s about 3%. 

Based on the above info, assuming we provide liquidity for a year, we Input the following parameters to the sheet

https://preview.redd.it/hg0uxwec9v981.jpg?width=1008&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9351cc4486661c42a0273fbf11428954c087b620

And it will generate the following charts

https://preview.redd.it/l484idzd9v981.png?width=873&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10db2bd76b70ebc6cc3c3313ed04f08f1672ee26

The horizontal x axis is the % change of token A (BNB)  while the y axis is the profit % of LP or Staking single coins. 

The above profit profile present the benefits of holding a LP pair vs staking single tokens, as it provides massive downside protection while still giving you good upside performance since Pancakeswap farming rewards mitigates the impermanent loss affect.

**Use LP autocompounding smart contracts.**

To further maximize your profit and minimize risk, best to put your LP into an autocompounding smart contract.  Those vault contracts automatically retrieve your farming rewards in CAKE, convert them to LPs and redeposit  it back into PCS farming pool, effectively compounding your principal and boosting your APYs.  For autocompounding vaults, I’d like to recommend [happyhippo.farm](https://happyhippo.farm), made by yours truly, the place where hippos are happy and everything is awesome, like the lego movie theme song. To help new traders settle in, hippo has a convenience Zap function that allows you convert directly from BNB/BUSD/BTCB/ETH/DAI to your desired LP pairs.

**Summarizing,**

To make easy money in BSC DeFI, follow these steps

1. Pick a Pancakeswap LP pair you like which has tokens that hopefully won’t go to 0 in less then a year. Use the google sheet to model P&amp;L if needed. 

2. Deposit those LPs into an autocompounding vault.

3. Don’t give your private key/seed phrase to strangers

4. Profit !",-0.9927089214324951,0.1506735930735931,0.43193102453102467,0.174,0.032,0.794,0.9996

They also accepted the funds from Mastercard and now are telling me I can only withdraw to Visa. Is this legal in the UK? They told me the only way to get cash back is to trade it back using their P2P feature.

2022-01-11 18:49:46,"I built DCAStack.com - An Automated Dollar Cost Averaging Bot for Binance (and more)! **DCA Stack - An Automated Dollar Cost Averaging Bot for Your Crypto**

Website: https://www.dcastack.com/

Source: https://github.com/Shazman96/DCAStack

&amp;nbsp;

*Why?*

&amp;nbsp;

I built this web app because I wanted a better way to automate my DCA purchases. Whili Binance does offer recurring buys, I found that it lacked the flexibility to DCA into any crypto (also the fact that I had to use a CC, that's additional fees?). I wanted something more so I went ahead and built this app, DCA Stack. Not only does it connect to Binance, but over 100 exchanges as well which makes DCA Stack a central hub to automate all your DCA schedules. And it all works with the FIAT/stablecoin you have on your exchange, so no more credit card juggling (some of my CCs wouldn't even go through).

And so DCA Stack was born, completely free, hoping to restore your purchasing power and ability :)

&amp;nbsp;

*How does it work?*

&amp;nbsp;

It works by directly interfacing with the APIs you generate on binance. What this means is that it trades on your behalf with funds on your account, you don't send any funds to DCA Stack. All trading takes place within binance at all times. For this to work, your API keys need to be enabled with the reading and spot trading permissions (for portfolio dashboard and order placing). Please **NEVER EVER** enable transfer permissions. We don't need it and we want to keep everyone safe by mitigating the risk of using your API keys with bots. 

Now I know what my mom used to say about trusting strangers on the internet with your API keys and crypto...so I also made the source code public! You can view, audit, and raise issues on anything you find strange. Initially, I wasn't going to but in the spirit of ""Don't Trust, Verify"", I figured the only way people would ever use a service like this is knowing it is safe to use. This should be the standard in the world of crypto and anything that uses your API keys to trade for you.

&amp;nbsp;

*Note on Bugs :O*

&amp;nbsp;

There may be bugs so please only use funds you're willing to spend and keep only the funds necessary to facilitate order trading per your DCA.

&amp;nbsp;

Looking forward to the community's thoughts and getting early user feedback!",-0.8321784734725952,0.17045454545454544,0.5780303030303031,0.113,0.035,0.852,0.9871

I used to post ads on Binance P2P in GBP and made a lot of money off of it after a long period of time. I noticed that a significant number of people I trade with don't have 'ethnically British' names. Now this can be expected in a multiethnic society like Britain. I noticed that a significantly large number of people I trade with have African names. Then something happened: someone sent me money from an account in a British woman's name (the Binance account also had the same name). My payments company contacted me about it, and after very, very long conversations, I was able to find out that he was a Nigerian scammer. And I was able to find out that many Nigerians defraud British women by 'online dating' them and then asking for money, which they transfer to themselves using Binance P2P. (I also got my payments company account banned, which I was able to get unbanned after a lot of effort). I had already noticed that these people can't speak proper English. Some of them had Sri Lankan names too. The problem is, after very long conversations with the scammer, I found out that these people actually live in Britain, and they have British bank accounts.
I want to keep making money with the legitiamte trades, but I want to filter out the scammers. I tried out a (spectacularly bad) idea. I made a condition that I will only trade with people with names that are 'ethnically British'. That was just so hard to phrase, because you know Britain is multiethnic. And then what happened was what I was apprehensive of: I ended up sounding and acting like a racist. One person with a Hindu name pretty awkwardly had to have conversation with me in which I asked him to prove his English skills. And only then I dealt with him. Another person (ethnically English) treated me the way I should have been treated with those terms: like an ignorant racist (I asked him to prove his English skills too). 
Anyways, here I am. I want to keep making by trading on Binance P2P. And I don't want to be part of any scam, don't want to make money enethically if I never get caught and nevet have to suffer and worldy consequences for it. And I have no idea how to filter out the scammers. Since the scammers are actually in Britain, can't check British ids. Can't ask for only 'ethnically English' names because that makes me sound like an ignorant racist. No way to check English skills. Really have no idea how to filter out the scammers.
If anybody here has an idea, please help me out.",-0.9999747276306152,0.027736386420596948,0.37241854636591476,0.057,0.111,0.832,-0.987

I use binance from browser because my screen is only 14 inches and binance desktop app is terrible to look at. In browser, I can zoom out and see more things clearly.

I'm verified, but I've only bought the crypto a few days ago. Is it similar to Gemini in that my ACH must complete with my bank before I'm able to withdraw? I'm just not seeing that error so it wasn't as intuitive as Gemini.

Btw the reason I'm not using Gemini is because [Binance.US](https://binance.us/) has now allowed for FTM to be withdrawn to its Native Mainnet (huge!!).

2022-01-17 07:36:32,"Withdrawing on Binance Question  

Hi all, good evening - thanks for checking my reply.

I'm having trouble withdrawing my FTM from Binance.US.

I'm wondering why I'm unable to enter an address to withdraw my Fantom...[please check out my screenshot here showing my unavailability to enter an address.](https://imgur.com/a/WQBi6Xp)

I'm verified, but I've only bought the crypto a few days ago. Is it similar to Gemini in that my ACH must complete with my bank before I'm able to withdraw? I'm just not seeing that error so it wasn't as intuitive as Gemini.

Btw the reason I'm not using Gemini is because Binance.US has now allowed for FTM to be withdrawn to its Native Mainnet (huge!!).

Anyways thanks in advance.

Best,

2022-01-19 12:07:12,"Binance Launches New 'Auto-Burning' Protocol for BNB to Replace Existing Mechanism The largest crypto exchange by far is Binance. Despite some regulatory hiccups in the past, the cryptocurrency exchange platform was trending in the news following its developments. Here was the most significant trend. In December 2021, the[ development of Binance](https://www.blockchainx.tech/bep20-token-development) officially announced the implementation of a new finance coin auto burn protocol to replace its current quarterly burn mechanism. This pointed to more “transparency and predictability” for their community.

Cryptocurrency exchange Binance implemented its first-ever Binance Token ( bnb) auto-burn program last quarter. according to the Auto-Burn procedure, remote more than 1.6 million BNB tokens are worth 750 million dollars in circulation.

The latest quarterly burn included an additional 6,296.305493 BNB. This was effectively burned through the Pioneer Burn Program, the tweet added.

### taking the different road

This was a major update. Until last month, Binance delisted BNB tokens on a quarterly basis based on the revenue it generated over a period. But, now, the exchange has implemented a new procedure, called BNB Auto-Burn.

The BNB Self-Recording Formula calculated the number of tokens withdrawn from circulation based on the BNB price. This reflected supply and demand as well as the number of blocks produced for that quarter. The BNB Auto-Burn system takes into consideration the following formula:

Here, B is the amount of BNB to burn. N is the total number of blocks produced on the Binance Smart Chain during the calendar quarter. P is an average price of BNB against the US dollar. K is a constant value as a price anchor, initially set to 1000.

Chang Peng Zhao (CZ), Co-Founder and CEO of Binance opined :

*“The implementation of BNB Auto-Burn is the next natural step in the BNB journey. It will help the BNB community grow by providing greater autonomy, transparency and predictability.”*

[Binance development](https://www.blockchainx.tech/bep20-token-development) started BNB fire in 2017 after the launch of the token. At that time it committed a total of 100 million BNB, that is, 50% of its total offer. Fast forward now, the graph looks like this:

Overall, the exchange destroyed nearly 35 million tokens through quarterly burns to date.",-0.994763195514679,0.13517807949626132,0.4347927325200052,0.09,0.037,0.874,0.9497

It is a blockchain application where we will be able to consult with AI about our health, current problems and the like. We will also be able to consult with doctors from all over the world online through the app.

Also everyone registers in the system and generates a certain number of coins. The ecosystem is supported by the medical data of millions of people and products from the pharmaceutical industry. Coins can therefore be used to pay for medical products and services, and holders can take full benefit of their bank accounts without having to carry cards.

In simple terms, we will receive most of the company's services for free, which for me is a real surprise.

Before making the transfer from Binance, the page asked me if the wallet to which I was making the transaction was compatible with the Binance Smart Chain network, so I started to investigate if Coinbase (which is the wallet that I started using) was compatible with this network, once verified through the application (attached screenshot) and on a Coinbase page ([https://help.coinbase.com/en/wallet/getting-started/what-types-of-crypto](https://help.coinbase.com/en/wallet/getting-started/what-types-of-crypto) \-does-wallet-support) I decided to carry out the transaction of the tokens, after a few moments and with the nerves that something would go wrong, the transaction is completed. I go to my Coinbase wallet to realize that nothing was found, and in my desperation I looked for any information that would be useful to me to solve this problem and nothing has helped me, I contacted Binance support and they told me that they did not know I couldn't do anything about it because of how the blockchain system worked and that it was irreversible, I also contacted Coinbase support and they told me that they don't work with the BSC network, and that I should have made a minor transfer before sending all the tokens, after that they stopped responding to me and when I opened the link that I had attached, I realized that they had banned my ip from the Coinbase help page (attached screenshot), after that they did not give me any other answer or the situation.

I had no choice but to use a forum like reddit (I've never made a post before) to find out if there is any solution to my problem, it may not be an exorbitant amount of money lost and it was my fault, but We are human and we all have the right to make mistakes. I leave you the data of the transaction and the information that I think may be important. Thank you very much in advance.

2022-01-24 12:54:00,"Binance bullying me into homelessness. Their blatant disregard for my life is appalling. Original was posted on /r/Cryptocurrency. This sub does not allow crossposting so here is the copypasta. 

Hey guys, my situation sucks. I’m posting here in hopes that it can get resolved quicker. Already received an eviction notice and started packing. Here’s what happened:

Tried to withdraw coins about three weeks ago to pay rent, like has been the case for a long time. Nothing unusual. Upon trying to withdraw, I got an email saying “Due to unusual activity on your account, your withdrawal function has been temporarily disabled.” 
Hold up. What? There is nothing unusual about this at all. The note left on the withdrawal on Binance says “risk control” … Bruh. My withdrawal was $1,100. Nothing risky or alarming about that. I’m just trying to pay rent. 
… 

Contacted CS, begrudgingly complied with all of the requests. Had to record the videos multiple times because every CS rep i spoke to kept giving me different instructions. etc etc. fast forward to me talking to a specialist and … they tell me 30-45 days until my withdrawals are unlocked. what? dude, how am I supposed to pay rent? 
..

Kept contacting CS, opening new tickets, etc, in order to see if this can get expedited. Over the next 20 days, I have spoken with at least 15 different entry level CS reps, 7 different specialists from “the escalation team” … all for them to tell me the same thing. “Thank you for your understanding and patience blah blah blah have fun getting evicted dude” 
..

How am I supposed to be patient or understanding when I have done absolutely nothing wrong? How am I supposed to be patient when I’m about to get evicted because Binance is bullying me for no reason? Despite me showing an incredible sense of urgency by contacting Binance so much, this has not gotten handled any faster.
..

I was fully compliant with every request, despite the fact that I was doing nothing wrong. The amount of things that have happened to me over the past year have broken me down, and i’m about to lose it. I keep getting kicked when i’m down. Looking for reasons to keep living, and this isn’t helping. Ending up on the streets because Binance is bullying me and won’t expedite my case is not making me want to keep living. I can’t even afford to get mental health right now, because all of my funds are locked up!!! for no reason!!!
.. 
after moving to a new country for work, my job closed down, girlfriend left me, dog ran away… dude this sucks. i have no more family back home, no where else to turn… no reason to keep going. if I end up on the streets soon because a big company bullied me into homelessness.. i’m just going to lose it i swear. 
..

If anyone from Binance sees this that can help me out… here’s my original case number: 

Case ID #81715082

Here’s the second case number, after I rage closed the original case after a the seventh or so specialist told me they couldn’t do anything for me and I just lost it:

Case ID #82151139

I don’t know how much longer I can keep going, especially if I end up on the streets in the next few days. I have full transcripts from these cases where I am begging and pleading , obviously in a bad state of mind , for Binance to do something to expedite these cases … nothing. “Thank you for your patience and understanding.” … 

…

I even asked Binance what were to happen to my funds if I were to off myself, and they didn’t give me a straight answer. I know I don’t have much money in my account, but i’d rather have it donated to a cause instead of just being absorbed by a big corporation!! For the record, because I doubt Binance will even honor my request.. I just want my funds passed on somewhere that helps people out in times of mental health crises .. somewhere that they may be used to help someone who can still be saved.",-0.999995231628418,0.0027867965367965384,0.43085961657390237,0.062,0.073,0.865,-0.6411

**Step 1**

Convert btc to other low fee coins like BCH(fee = $0.30) or LTC(fee=0.10)

**Step 2**

Withdraw it to a multi-chain wallet that has swaps and low withdrawal fees

recommendations are the bitcoin dot com wallet it has low swap fees

**Step 3**

Withdraw to the wallet of your choice 😀

Most beginners don't know this and end up paying a portion of their investment to transfer fees

Now, I see this Notice that the Multiple Leverage Tokens will be Cease Redemption too. Seriously??? 

We have invested so much money into Binance Leverage Token and now you cease Redemption. 

This is just unacceptable to us as Investors in Binance. We are not happy at all. This is a Daylight loot you are doing in the open taking away the money we have invested. 

Do you expect us to sell the Tokens right now when prices of all crypto have fallen and at total loss??? WTF!

First, install Binance Chain app on your ledger from Ledger Live (in 'Manager').

Then, gather all your BNB in your Binance Chain Wallet, on the Binance Chain Network (address starting with 'bnb', blockchain referred to as BEP2). If you've done so already, then skip this bit.

1. ensure you have the Binance Chain Wallet (BCW) chrome extension installed.. if not, set it up
2. now move your BNB to that wallet:
   1. if from binance exchange, then may as well use BEP2 network directly. To do that, on BCW, top side, select 'Binance Chain Network' and your address will begin with 'bnb'.. copy and paste it in the withdrawal address on the exchange (ensure selected network is BEP2!).
   2. if from defi's, then on BCW select 'Binance Smart Chain', copy the ERC20 address starting with '0x', and send everything there (from Pancake Swap and etc.)
3. from BCW, send your BNB in Binance Smart Chain to your BEP2 address starting with 'bnb'. A message will appear saying 'Note: Cross Chain Transfer to Binance Chain', which is perfectly fine.

Now, ensure that BCW is on 'Binance Chain Network', then click on account (the square in the upper right corner), and then on 'Hardware Wallet'.. Follow the shown instructions (easy), and your Ledger BEP2 address will be displayed (you'll have to pick one)! Copy it.

Switch account back to the address with BNB inside, and send it over to the ledger address you just copied. (they're both BEP2, so no issues)..  Done!

Now, ensure that BCW is on 'Binance Chain Network', then click on account (the square in the upper right corner), and then on 'Hardware Wallet'.. Follow the shown instructions (easy), and your Ledger BEP2 address will be displayed (you'll have to pick one)! Copy it.

Switch account back to the address with BNB inside, and send it over to the ledger address you just copied. (they're both BEP2, so no issues).. Done!

2022-01-29 22:02:43,"Feel like this binance grid liquidation is wrong or is it?  I opened a LONG leveraged (20X) grid trade position on PeopleUSDT about a day ago on Binance.

The position was doing ok, over night it seemed to really go bullish and today it was 'volatile' the value of People went up to 0.07+.

Here is screenshot of the position:

https://preview.redd.it/26sz4867mne81.png?width=796&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6ea5bfe3c2d883c7059f484832366a8b2da0b051

 So according to my understanding.. At no point after opening the position did the value drop below the Stop Loss or Range I set. No Take Profit was set. (Ive just opened a new PeopleUSDT grid position and noticed the Liquidation Price is shown under Running grids and is below the Stop Loss.)

So I was in profit on this...and would still be if the position had not been liquidated.

I also received this push notification:

https://preview.redd.it/1ze6tjz8mne81.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e627549549ab24d8af4237a846dbebe5678a05b

 So here is what i dont understand.... This sort of push notification normally you get if say a Long position value had dropped to a level where the money you invested would not cover the trade....as in near the margin. But on my grid trade the the price was no where near the lower margin....

I opened the grid at 0.05250, the value never reached anywhere near that on liquidation.

The value of People from time of opening and time of liquidation, was always between the range i set and way above the stop loss.

So is this normal?",-0.9999939203262329,0.06969696969696969,0.4545454545454546,0.058,0.111,0.832,-0.8676

It's been a fun few years, but you're now no longer friendly to the UK, having let the regulators pile in. 

First we couldn't send bank transfers, then we could no longer use our credit cards. Now debit cards are falling off a cliff one bank after another. It's clear the regulator is removing all on and off ramps with fiat, which is fine.

Having gone through AML and KYC in the past with Binance, the UK regulators now request everyone in the UK do so again, which means Binance slowly but surely become heavily centralised and regulated by stealth to the point of a regular banking account, and will undoubtably continue to do so as governments pile in.

I am from ES Europe so please don't mind my bad English. Keep in mind it all happened last week and i am trying to have a refund from Binance and my order dispute is still in process. This scammer used Transferwise as payment method.  Let me explain the whole process. 

Once you have your P2P sell ad online you will receive an order. The buyer will send you a screenshot saying that transaction will take one business days and if you are ok with it.

**Shill text:**

While most cryptocurrencies over fluff, promise what they can't deliver, and pull rugs like they're bed sheets, ShitCoin does not want to follow in those footsteps. Instead, the goal of ShitCoin is to be the comedian; Shitcoin is only delivering the same Shit that other currencies are promising: which is A Shitty Medium of Exchange, and make your own damn NFTurds.

ShitCoin was created to be an end-all meme coin driven by its own community, for investors looking to hop on the ShitRocket to the moon. While many may see the actual token as useless because it is classified as a meme coin, the reality is that ShitCoin will provide the exact shit that it says it will, without the pretentiousness. Because ShitCoin is like the comedian, and the industry is just full of jokes, ShitCoin can constantly evolve to parody the current trash coins, becoming the ultimate meme.

The difference between other shit coins and THE ShitCoin is that general shit coins claim to be the next leader, but are shit. THE Shitcoin claims that it is shit and it delivers exactly what it claims to be. It is the ultimate shit coin. In short, it's an honest coin.

The creator is completely doxxed and has renounced ownership, and owns only the dev wallet. 1% of all transactions are directed to the dev wallet. This wallet will be used to fund exchange listings. We are still small, but has a Social Media presence on Twitter and Reddit. The toilet paper is a must-read and it’s on the ShitCoin website ShitCoin69 .com.

Shitcoin also passes every token sniffer test, 99/99 on DEXTools, are audited and seeking Legal Opinion letter when NFTurd utility release

Current Price is around 1 penny at a 250k MC. There are a limited 21M Shitcoins, with 500k already burnt.

I am based in UK. I'm already verified with binance before I got this new notification. So why binance asking me to re-verify when I already have verified status before, I gave them my passport &amp; details before so why Binance asking me to do the same verify process again? Seems suspicious, has Binance been hacked where the hackers stole all the customer KYC information like passports &amp; driving licenses so Binance asking for them again?

I clicked on notifications on the binance site to complete this re-verification and get the following on screen:

'***Assurance Review Failed. Based on our Terms of Use and Internal Policy, these features are not available for your account.'***

***'Review time: 20 days'.*** Button next to it is greyed out displaying Unavailable so I cant even re-verify so what is going on?

Lastly are these emails legit?: [do\_not\_reply@mgmailer2.binance.com](mailto:do_not_reply@mgmailer2.binance.com) &amp; [do\_not\_reply@mgmailer.binance.com](mailto:do_not_reply@mgmailer.binance.com)because I two received emails from binance saying in email click to re-verify by 11th Feb deadline!

I am from ES Europe so please don't mind my bad English. Keep in mind it all happened last week and i am trying to have a refund from Binance and my order dispute is still in process. This scammer used Transferwise as payment method. Let me explain the whole process.

If you say yes, they will start the transfer and send you the receipt.

**Update**: As per Binance rep, they cannot transfer my USDT from Scammer Account by themselves, they need his authorization and Scammer is telling them he will be transferring the Euros to my Wise account.

There was no fee, but the spread was really high, I calculated around 5-6% difference between the market price of BTC and the cheapest trade sale available in CAD. It's by far the biggest spread I've paid. 

* Why do people pay these high P2P spreads? 

I am looking into Binance Earn, just to see what it's like, what it can do. I like the idea of enhanced (APY %). Double digit yields.

Last years I staked 1 ETH and I got BETH as reward plus daily reward. Also Binance restricted my account because of my nationality caused by FATF and US sanctions. That's why I could only transfer my assets to another wallet from Binance, but I can't transfer that 1.0298 BETH anywhere because I have no access to any wallet supporting BETB token. That's why I request Binance to refund it as ETH so I can transfer it, they promised to do it last month (February 2022) but they didn't and now after 50 hours of chatting they say refund will be sent at the end if this month. If I didn't need the fund I could have waited, but I really need that fund because of a problem that's hurting me now. So please share your idea and help me with this issue.

I then tried verifying it using the internet bill of old address thinking I’ll change address at a later date but a screenshot of that address was rejected too.

It would be nice if verfied accounts don't get the notifications, because it's making me anxious that I've missed something.

The only thing I can see to do on the verfication page is to ""increase limits"" on fiat withdrawal or deposit, which isn't something I want to do, becuase I don't need to increase the limits.

Am I missing something??

In the ""Binance - Privacy notice"" which was last updated January 12 2022 it states:

### 8. What Information Can I Access?

You  can access your information, including your name, address, payment  options, profile information, and transaction history in the ""Your  Account"" section of the website. 

However, I can't seem to find this ""your account"" section of the website. 

While speaking to support in the app, with regards to the verification stuff, I was advised I need to provide a bill / reciept etc as proof of address, despite the fact that I have no button / option / otherwise on the ""Personal Verification"" page to engage / provide any of this. The page simply states ""verified"" and ""completed""

Support said they are ""looking into it"" and following that I asked where I could find my personal information, to which I was told:

""I apologise for the inconvenience, you cannot view sir it's for security purpose. you cannot see their own details""

which is total bullshit and from what I understand unlawful - not to mention a direct contradiction of the privacy policy. The policy does also state that I have the right to request any of that information:

### 9. What Rights Do I Have?

If you have any questions or objection as to how we collect and process your personal information, please contact [dpo@binance.com](mailto:dpo@binance.com).When you consent to our processing your personal information for a specified purpose, you may withdraw your consent at any time.In addition, **subject to applicable law**,  you have the right to request access to, correct, and delete your  personal data, and to ask for data portability. You may also object to  our processing of your personal data or ask that we restrict the  processing of your personal data in certain instances, by contacting [dpo@binance.com](mailto:dpo@binance.com). 

So, before I look to push this further, I was wondering if any one knows where I can view my previously provided personal information?

I can request this via the above email if absoloutely required, but given that the privacy policy states I can access this on the website, I should be able to

**Common problems &amp; solutions**

**1. Crypto withdrawal suspended**

● You receive a message saying ‘withdrawal suspended due to risk control’ and have been trying to unlock your account.

● Don’t worry, your funds are SAFU. Our agents will try their best to help unlock the withdrawal - please coordinate with our team and provide relevant information when prompted to do so.

● Withdrawal Risk can be triggered by a number of reasons. Risk control is extremely important. Please note that we can only help you if we deem your case to be legitimate, if you have attempted to hack an account and request for unsuspension, you will be unsuccessful as we have processes in place to prevent this.

Our team works extremely hard to resolve these issues as soon as possible and some cases can take time to resolve but please keep in mind the reason for this is to ensure you, our users, are safe.

**Cases replied by our mods are already in the escalation process. A longer wait after escalation = our team is working hard at investigating the issue.** If there are any updates to the case, our agents will reply to you directly in the chat.

Please refrain from leaving multiple messages in this thread if your case has already been escalated.

**2. Security issues**

● Report hacked accounts and funds.

● Difficulty to reset 2FA and gain access to your account.

**3. Fiat deposit &amp; withdrawal**

● Fiat (not crypto) is taking longer than expected to arrive in your bank / Binance account.

● Involves intermediaries such as bank transfers or buying crypto with credit/debit cards.

● *Note: It can take up to several working days for the money to be credited to your accounts.* [You can find more FAQ here](https://twitter.com/BinanceHelpDesk/status/1391776637071478787)

**4. US persons accessing old Binance.com accounts for offboarding &amp; withdrawal of funds**

● Your funds are SAFU. If you experience issues with withdrawing remaining funds, follow the above steps to get to our live chat queue - our agents will try our best to assist you with the offboarding.

**5. Trading system and other account issues**

● Spot, margin &amp; futures trading

● P2P disputes

● Binance Visa Card transactions

● Unable to complete KYC

● Any other issues

**Please follow the format stated above, your case cannot be escalated if you do not follow this process and your comment may be removed. Following the format helps us classify and identify the issues, escalate them to our relevant departments and get everyone’s problems resolved.** ***Spamming the feed is unfair to other users and will result in a ban.***

They raised over a billion for a new blockchain called PulseChain back in July-August 2021.  The developers are still finalizing everything and are working on PulseX the Dex for the Pulse blockchain.  The new blockchain mainnet is supposed to be going live and trading in roughly 1-2 months.

1. Why is Binance already listing a coin that hasn't even been released yet?
2. This indicates Binance analysts are following this pre-release and are openly letting others know this. Why? Are they planning to list it upon launch?
3. It also indicates Binance saw it as a marketing opportunity to put up the pages on Binance and CoinmarketCap, a website owned by Binance, to get traffic from the interest in the coin: [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pulsechain](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pulsechain/)
4. It's currently on 13,700+ watchlists on your website CoinMarketCap.  That seems like a lot of portfolios!  Is that enough to list it when it launches? My guess is most people don't go through the trouble of signing in to add coins to their watchlist, so there is likely even more interest than that.

Cryptography is a safe engine of growth. Some regard it as a hoax, while others see it as a genuine possibility to make money. It all relies on your thought and freedom of choice, in my opinion. You could attempt and fail, or you could try and fail but not expose the opportunity.

I just got aware of a new trend in the cryptoworld. I'm referring to competitions. They called out to me. I wished them well. But the dread of losing out won out. When I learned that the prize pool was almost a million dollars, I began to have my doubts. Last year, I became acquainted with an intriguing business called LOT.TRADE, which piqued my curiosity with its promotional and slogans like ""tournaments for all levels of traders."" They didn't guarantee millions of dollars in awards, but rather thousands of dollars and even prizes for the finest performances or anything along those lines. The biggest advantage was the availability of a live list of outcomes. Everyone, including those who were skeptical and did not participate in the event, could watch the combat.

On top of that, there are free access, private tournaments, and master competitions for anybody who is interested. These gentlemen have stated that they would be hosting one-of-a-kind tournaments with higher rewards and competition. Meanwhile, they will issue a certain number of various grade NFTs, ensuring participation in these tournaments, up to 55% APY(!) and, of course, a share of the prize pool.

I'm not going to advertise it, but people who understand what I'm saying will undoubtedly be interested. These NFTs are being decreased by up to 30% at the moment.",-0.9985073208808899,0.11347402597402599,0.46967442279942273,0.194,0.074,0.732,0.9912

It was a few cents back then. I logged onto my account with a VPN the other day and was surprised to see that it’s now worth a few hundred dollars. 

I converted it to Bitcoin to try and send it to my wallet, but when I tried to do the withdrawal it told me that my account withdrawal function is suspended because of suspicious activity.

The bank said that they were used to these kind of issues with binance and that I should just wait it out a few days, but now my account is in overdrawn and my bank will charge me for it.

In my binance account the balance is 0, and in the transaction history i find the the withdrawal with the status completed, but the money they charged back is nowhere to be found.

I proceeded to appeal said withdrawal because i dont know any other way to get in touch with support.

This is not a P2P transaction, it was a direct withdrawal in fiat to my bank account via my card, not SEPA.

Did anyone of you got this issue, what happened ?

thanks a lot and sorry 4 the long post.

2022-02-19 23:24:23,"Arbitrage Binance / WazirX Hi, im just got into the whole topic of arbitrage trading 2 days ago. The last 24 hours i have done a lot of research but its way harder than i thought to actually execute proper arbitrage trades. Then i remembered hearing about arbitraging in different regions/markets (for example europe and korean or indian markets) as the rates are can be very different. I start with indian exchanges and found WazirX, Bitbns and CoinDCX. For the first test i looked at ICP. Here my (theoretical) maths without!! looking at trading or withdrawal/deposit fees. For the example i use 1000 USD:

My trading path:

1. On Binance, buy 1000 USD worth of ICP for 19,45 USD each = 51,41 ICP
2. Send it to WazirX and sell it for 78.771,94 INR what equals 1054,73 USD
3. Then i have 78771,94 INR that i somehow have to convert to USD or anything else that i can actually use.

I thought: Great this should work fine. But now the weird part:

WazirX has the pair ICP/INR as well as ICP/USDT. The prices in this exact second (they do not match the prices of my example above, that happened about 24 hours earlier):

1. ICP/INR = 1585,90 INR what equals 21,23 USD
2. ICP/USDT = 19,88 USDT

So what am i missing here? How is the difference between the two pairs so big? So in this case i would have to sell the ICP. So i did the same math with BNB and came to the same result. WazirX INR prices are way higher than the equivalent USDT pairs.

1. Binance: 1 BNB = 399,40 USDT = 29.828,95 INR
2. WazirX: 1 BNB = 31.466,18 euqal to 421,32 USDT
3. BitBns: 1 BNB = 31.748,17 INR euqal to 423,10 USDT
4. CoinDCX: 1 BNB = 31.400 INR euqal to 420,44 USDT

I still cant believe that this is correct and i feel like i am missing something. Otherwise this would be arbitrage heaven. Please someone wake me up and tell me where i went wrong with my thoughts.",-0.9988848567008972,0.03866666666666667,0.30519999999999997,0.065,0.032,0.903,0.928

Also, it will introduce new and advanced new capabilities in the near future. Under the new name BNB Chain, the chain has in fact become a governance part. The Binance Chain, where staking and voting takes place, has become the BNB Beacon Chain. The Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible, multi-chain-supported Binance Smart Chain simply referred to as BNB Smart Chain is still abbreviated as BSC. In addition, the BNB Chain will bring all its Web3 development under the umbrella of 'MetaFi'. This MetaFi should bring developers and projects from the Metaverse together with GameFi and SocialFi.

For a little bit of context, I filed a lawsuit against BAM TRADING SERVICES INC. aka Binance U.S. in the court of San Francisco, CA, small claims division.

I was a customer of the original Binance website, and couldn't get my account or bank account verified with Binance U.S. for over 9 months, and it magically only became verified just as the bull run ended this year. I contacted customer service \*many\* times, many times.

When I contacted customer service, I would receive no reply for weeks at a time. I found notices finally that said they were backlogged and 'doing their best,' but they were still taking new customers, this button never disappeared despite the backlog claim. Binance U.S. took all my information, promised me the basic ability to buy, sell, and trade crypto, and held my account until the coins I would purchase were at maximum cost. I relied on Binance U.S. to verify my account in a timely fashion once they took all my sensitive personal information, my social security number, my bank account routing, account, and balance numbers. My address. My phone number.

I imagine the only counter argument is 'you could have gone to a different exchange.' Each time I received notice from Binance, they assured me it was temporary, and honestly, am I supposed to just spam all these details all over the internet in \*the hope\* that one of the parties receiving it is honest about their offereing? I don't see how any of this is in good faith, so I filed a lawsuit for the losses. I have a lot of documentation proving even the specific cryptocurrency I was trying to purchase as well.

When I contacted Binance parent company a couple times, I got an instant same day response, just like you would expect from the world's largest cryptocurrency market. They know this is a reasonable expectation. I read a lot that Binance U.S. is just a regulatory cover to keep the real activity on Binance. I'm not rich, I'm not deep into the market, I just wanted to buy a reasonable amount of cryptocurrency after the election ended. I saw someone else post about how Binance did the exact same thing to them, and how they literally cried at the loss, and I decided I would file my lawsuit.

The lawsuit was very easy to file. I looked up Binance U.S.' business records, starting with the info from their website. I found BAM TRADING SERVICES INC with the secretary of state(every state has some kind of collection of records of corporations doing business inside of them), I filled out all the required paperwork, and asked the court to serve the papers. I am indigent, so it cost literally nothing. Yes, you can file a lawsuit over something like this without spending a penny if you are poor. Do the reading, we should all know how to do it.

So today, I got a text today from a producer at the television show 'Hot Bench' in Los Angeles, CA. They've asked if I would like to litigate my case on their show. I could sue Binance U.S on live television, and everyone in the crypto community could watch.

What do you think?

P.S. - For the record, I'm clearly a big fan of crypto, I wanted to buy in at what I think is a terrific safe time: after the election when everyone remembers the current system is dogshit and starts buying out. This isn't an attack on crypto, I just want these people to play fair with us if they are going to become disgustingly rich along the way.",-0.9999532699584961,0.1836770140428677,0.5667775314116777,0.131,0.063,0.806,0.9936

2022-01-02 20:38:46,"Binance Smart Chain Network (Coinbase Wallet) Hello,

I recently send USDT from a Binance Smart Chain network in my MetaMask wallet to my Coinbase Wallet. When it didn't show up, I realized I had made a mistake; however, when I switch the CB Wallet network over to Binance Smart Chain, the USDT appears. After a bit of research, I now realize that when I originally converted BNB to USDT, it did not occur cross-chain, and the USDT I received was BEP-20.

In order to send the USDT(BEP-20) out of CoinBase Wallet, it is requiring ETH for the transaction fee. Being that I am attempting the transfer from the Binance Smart Chain network, I cannot put ETH onto the network to use as a Txn fee. I tried sending ETH, but it went to the ETH network instead. I also tried sending ETH (BEP20), but it never showed up.

Any ideas about what I can do to get the USDT (BEP20) off the BSC network? Ultimately, I want to convert it to ETH. Thank you.",-0.9999551773071289,0.17602040816326528,0.6530612244897959,0.067,0.009,0.924,0.8126

2022-01-04 18:29:55,"Probability of losing your money if you keep it on Binance Please don't attack my ignorance. I am asking a serious question.

Many people in the crypto world recommend to move your assets to cold wallets. I understand how that is done and why.

But it's much more productive for trading, and easier for day to day life, to keep my assets in the Binance spot wallet.

Actually, I am thinking to move most of my money into Binance. Inflation is killing my Fiat anyway.

But I wonder if this is really as risky as people say. I don't see the chance of Binance getting hacked bigger than the chance of my actual Bank getting hacked. Binance makes so much money that they probably have a level of security that touches the sky. And as long as I keep my 2FA and don't fall into phishing traps, I will be fine.

The only potential issue I see is, a normal Bank is more regulated and I have the guarantee that a certain amount of my money will be recovered even if the Bank disappears. With Binance, if it disappears... I guess I will lose everything.

My first post here on not such a pleasant topic. I am owed several refunds for a transactions worth thousands of EUR from my Binance VISA debit card. Two of the refunds are from more than 30 working days. I contacted Binance Customer Service on several occasions during the period only to be told the same thing over and over: ""Please be patient and give us some more time."" ""We understand your problem and are passing your inquiry to the relevant department. Wait 12-24 hours"" Then nobody follows up.

There is no resolution of the problem, with every new chat I have to explain the same things to different people. Really disappointed in the handling of the refunds and I am now beginning to think that I might lose a substantial amount of money.

The refunds were made by PayPal / eBay and they complete their refunds to a bank issued credit card in 3-5 days always. I don't understand what is causing this massive delay on Binance end.

2022-01-05 18:37:26,"Stop Worrying About the Dip and Make Easy Money in the Binance Smart Chain by Providing Liquidity Since you are in /r/binance, you’re probably already using it as your exchange,  if so why not take the next step and dive into the BSC ecosystem.  This post is intended for Binancians new to DeFI  with the aim of showcasing simple but profitable liquidity farming techniques in BSC.

**A Layman Introduction to Decentralized Finance (DeFI)**

When people talk about DeFI, usually it means they’re playing around with a chrome browser extension called MetaMask. MetaMask is a cryptocurrency wallet for EVM compatible blockchain like Ethereum, Binance smart chain, polygon and etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fsjpb4i89v981.png?width=200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf50017c6cb847bdde609cb474faf9cb6fa8917f

[https://metamask.io/](https://metamask.io/)

There’s also a dedicated binance chain wallet, 

[https://docs.binance.org/smart-chain/wallet/binance.html](https://docs.binance.org/smart-chain/wallet/binance.html)

With easier integration to your binance account though it doesn’t yet have a mobile app version, so if you plan to interact mostly from your phone,  stick to Metamask. Both wallets let’s you interact with smart contracts in the blockchain via frontend websites called Dapps/WEB3.0. You can do a lot of things in those Dapps like making bets, trading,  saving/lending , staking and providing liquidity.

**Providing Liquidity in DeFI**

In a DeFI Decentralized Exchange (DEX) like Ethereum’s Uniswap or their BSC counterpart, Pancakeswap,  there are no order books instead every trade you make happens against a liquidity pool provided by liquidity providers (LP). The mechanism is called Automated Market Makers (AMM), in which liquidity providers stake an equal value of paired tokens, ETH-USDT for example, and in return for facilitating trade receives a LP/Flip token and \~ 0.17-0.25%  of the trade volume that occurs in that pool. 

[https://finematics.com/liquidity-pools-explained/](https://finematics.com/liquidity-pools-explained/)

**Introducing Binance Smart Chain (BSC), the 2nd most popular destination for LPs**

As Ethereum gas fees (the cost to make a transaction in the blockchain) has risen to hundreds of dollars per Tx, it has driven a lot of retail investors to BSC. BSC currently holds the top position in number of transactions per day and wins in ease of use due to the smooth integration of it’s bsc wallet with binance.com. Being  a much younger ecosystem compared to ETH there are still plenty of opportunities in BSC to get high passive income returns measured in annualized percentage yield (APY) however the low barrier to entry has also made it into a  “rug pull central” of sorts for scam coins and projects. 

**How to tell if a BSC DeFI project is a scam/Ponzi** 

Ok this is important to know before you go diving into BSC and it’s not only about all the dog and moon coins out there but plenty of other projects that looks very formal and solid but is actually a Ponzi/scam.  Technically speaking, A Ponzi scheme is **an investment fraud that pays existing investors with funds collected from new investors**.  In my view, in general, a coin or a Dapp needs to provide some other functions besides playing tricks with liquidity to not be considered as a Ponzi. For example, Pancakeswap facilitates coin trading in BSC, Venus provides crypto savings/lending and Chromia is a SaaS for games. You can tell those are not Ponzi as they provide actual utility while the Ponzi ones usually starts with a variation of the following statement

*“Why is bitcoin considered to not be a Ponzi …. “*

Then will go on to explain why similar to bitcoin,  their coin/project is also not a Ponzi  due to the belief from a large group of people and some convoluted explanation on how their advanced algorithm maintains liquidity. Of course it usually has some crazy high APYs like 1,000,000% for staking and  do a lot of rebasing. Rebasing is the practice of reducing and or increasing the supply of a token, including the ones already in your wallet to achieve a certain price target. So for the token creators to let’s say increase the price by 1,000%, rather then buying the tokens in the liquidity pools he could just reduce the supply by 90%. Obviously in this process no real value is created as it’s just a liquidity shell game which would have to collapse at some point. 

**Nonetheless there are plenty of genuine gems in BSC**

**Like Pancakeswap (PCS) for example,** they are the leading DEX in BSC and have surpassed Uniswap in both transaction count and volume since a few months ago.  PCS provides farming rewards for liquidity providers which means in addition to receiving LP fees from the trading pool, Liquidity Providers can also stake the LP tokens in PCS farms to receive rewards in CAKE token. This reward is often more lucrative then the trading fees it self as it can reach hundreds of percent APY depending on the amount of liquidity in the pool.  A popular LP pair for investors in PCS is the CAKE-BNB pair which earns great rewards while not being too volatile. 

**Calculating**  **Liquidity Providing Profit in Pancakeswap**

You can use a google sheet I created to model Pool value and profit vs  changes in the underlying token prices. , 

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h0uzbnpO7SP1mPw3tj2w-CJ2wKsx7P4DCHgKflgJWoY/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h0uzbnpO7SP1mPw3tj2w-CJ2wKsx7P4DCHgKflgJWoY/edit?usp=sharing)

So for example, to model the BNB-BUSD liquidity pair, from PCS analytics info we know that the LP fees ,the estimated transaction fees APR this pool will receive,  is about 15%  and the farming rewards is 20%. From Binance website we see that if you stake BNB you’ll earn about \~9-10% a year and for BUSD it’s about 3%. 

Based on the above info, assuming we provide liquidity for a year, we Input the following parameters to the sheet

https://preview.redd.it/hg0uxwec9v981.jpg?width=1008&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9351cc4486661c42a0273fbf11428954c087b620

And it will generate the following charts

https://preview.redd.it/l484idzd9v981.png?width=873&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10db2bd76b70ebc6cc3c3313ed04f08f1672ee26

The horizontal x axis is the % change of token A (BNB)  while the y axis is the profit % of LP or Staking single coins. 

The above profit profile present the benefits of holding a LP pair vs staking single tokens, as it provides massive downside protection while still giving you good upside performance since Pancakeswap farming rewards mitigates the impermanent loss affect.

**Use LP autocompounding smart contracts.**

To further maximize your profit and minimize risk, best to put your LP into an autocompounding smart contract.  Those vault contracts automatically retrieve your farming rewards in CAKE, convert them to LPs and redeposit  it back into PCS farming pool, effectively compounding your principal and boosting your APYs.  For autocompounding vaults, I’d like to recommend [happyhippo.farm](https://happyhippo.farm), made by yours truly, the place where hippos are happy and everything is awesome, like the lego movie theme song. To help new traders settle in, hippo has a convenience Zap function that allows you convert directly from BNB/BUSD/BTCB/ETH/DAI to your desired LP pairs.

**Summarizing,**

To make easy money in BSC DeFI, follow these steps

1. Pick a Pancakeswap LP pair you like which has tokens that hopefully won’t go to 0 in less then a year. Use the google sheet to model P&amp;L if needed. 

2. Deposit those LPs into an autocompounding vault.

3. Don’t give your private key/seed phrase to strangers

4. Profit !",-0.9927089214324951,0.1506735930735931,0.43193102453102467,0.174,0.032,0.794,0.9996

They also accepted the funds from Mastercard and now are telling me I can only withdraw to Visa. Is this legal in the UK? They told me the only way to get cash back is to trade it back using their P2P feature.

2022-01-11 18:49:46,"I built DCAStack.com - An Automated Dollar Cost Averaging Bot for Binance (and more)! **DCA Stack - An Automated Dollar Cost Averaging Bot for Your Crypto**

Website: https://www.dcastack.com/

Source: https://github.com/Shazman96/DCAStack

&amp;nbsp;

*Why?*

&amp;nbsp;

I built this web app because I wanted a better way to automate my DCA purchases. Whili Binance does offer recurring buys, I found that it lacked the flexibility to DCA into any crypto (also the fact that I had to use a CC, that's additional fees?). I wanted something more so I went ahead and built this app, DCA Stack. Not only does it connect to Binance, but over 100 exchanges as well which makes DCA Stack a central hub to automate all your DCA schedules. And it all works with the FIAT/stablecoin you have on your exchange, so no more credit card juggling (some of my CCs wouldn't even go through).

And so DCA Stack was born, completely free, hoping to restore your purchasing power and ability :)

&amp;nbsp;

*How does it work?*

&amp;nbsp;

It works by directly interfacing with the APIs you generate on binance. What this means is that it trades on your behalf with funds on your account, you don't send any funds to DCA Stack. All trading takes place within binance at all times. For this to work, your API keys need to be enabled with the reading and spot trading permissions (for portfolio dashboard and order placing). Please **NEVER EVER** enable transfer permissions. We don't need it and we want to keep everyone safe by mitigating the risk of using your API keys with bots. 

Now I know what my mom used to say about trusting strangers on the internet with your API keys and crypto...so I also made the source code public! You can view, audit, and raise issues on anything you find strange. Initially, I wasn't going to but in the spirit of ""Don't Trust, Verify"", I figured the only way people would ever use a service like this is knowing it is safe to use. This should be the standard in the world of crypto and anything that uses your API keys to trade for you.

&amp;nbsp;

*Note on Bugs :O*

&amp;nbsp;

There may be bugs so please only use funds you're willing to spend and keep only the funds necessary to facilitate order trading per your DCA.

&amp;nbsp;

Looking forward to the community's thoughts and getting early user feedback!",-0.8321784734725952,0.17045454545454544,0.5780303030303031,0.113,0.035,0.852,0.9871

2022-01-12 17:25:06,"How to filter out scammers when posting ads on Binance This must be a very difficult question to answer.
I used to post ads on Binance P2P in GBP and made a lot of money off of it after a long period of time. I noticed that a significant number of people I trade with don't have 'ethnically British' names. Now this can be expected in a multiethnic society like Britain. I noticed that a significantly large number of people I trade with have African names. Then something happened: someone sent me money from an account in a British woman's name (the Binance account also had the same name). My payments company contacted me about it, and after very, very long conversations, I was able to find out that he was a Nigerian scammer. And I was able to find out that many Nigerians defraud British women by 'online dating' them and then asking for money, which they transfer to themselves using Binance P2P. (I also got my payments company account banned, which I was able to get unbanned after a lot of effort). I had already noticed that these people can't speak proper English. Some of them had Sri Lankan names too. The problem is, after very long conversations with the scammer, I found out that these people actually live in Britain, and they have British bank accounts.
I want to keep making money with the legitiamte trades, but I want to filter out the scammers. I tried out a (spectacularly bad) idea. I made a condition that I will only trade with people with names that are 'ethnically British'. That was just so hard to phrase, because you know Britain is multiethnic. And then what happened was what I was apprehensive of: I ended up sounding and acting like a racist. One person with a Hindu name pretty awkwardly had to have conversation with me in which I asked him to prove his English skills. And only then I dealt with him. Another person (ethnically English) treated me the way I should have been treated with those terms: like an ignorant racist (I asked him to prove his English skills too). 
Anyways, here I am. I want to keep making by trading on Binance P2P. And I don't want to be part of any scam, don't want to make money enethically if I never get caught and nevet have to suffer and worldy consequences for it. And I have no idea how to filter out the scammers. Since the scammers are actually in Britain, can't check British ids. Can't ask for only 'ethnically English' names because that makes me sound like an ignorant racist. No way to check English skills. Really have no idea how to filter out the scammers.

What happened was that I made these drawings, closed the browser, shut down pc then opened it the next day and all sell orders were missing from all charts and the horizontal lines were present in only one chart.

I use binance from browser because my screen is only 14 inches and binance desktop app is terrible to look at. In browser, I can zoom out and see more things clearly.

So I reported binance about it and they said they'll lock the funds of the buyer and sent a confirmation mail so I could send to bank.

Until today the sender's bank hasn't taken any action against it. So I contacted binance to give an update, Now binance is telling me that the buyer account is only locked and the funds he has already withdrawn.

**Common problems &amp; solutions**

**1. Crypto withdrawal suspended**

● You receive a message saying ‘withdrawal suspended due to risk control’ and have been trying to unlock your account.

● Don’t worry, your funds are SAFU. Our agents will try their best to help unlock the withdrawal - please coordinate with our team and provide relevant information when prompted to do so.

● Withdrawal Risk can be triggered by a number of reasons. Risk control is extremely important. Please note that we can only help you if we deem your case to be legitimate, if you have attempted to hack an account and request for unsuspension, you will be unsuccessful as we have processes in place to prevent this. 

Our team works extremely hard to resolve these issues as soon as possible and some cases can take time to resolve but please keep in mind the reason for this is to ensure you, our users, are safe.

**Cases replied by our mods are already in the escalation process. A longer wait after escalation = our team is working hard at investigating the issue.** If there are any updates to the case, our agents will reply to you directly in the chat.

Please refrain from leaving multiple messages in this thread if your case has already been escalated.

**2. Security issues**

● Report hacked accounts and funds.

● Difficulty to reset 2FA and gain access to your account.

**3. Fiat deposit &amp; withdrawal**

● Fiat (not crypto) is taking longer than expected to arrive in your bank / Binance account.

● Involves intermediaries such as bank transfers or buying crypto with credit/debit cards.

● *Note: It can take up to several working days for the money to be credited to your accounts.* [You can find more FAQ here](https://twitter.com/BinanceHelpDesk/status/1391776637071478787)

**4. US persons accessing old Binance.com accounts for offboarding &amp; withdrawal of funds**

● Your funds are SAFU. If you experience issues with withdrawing remaining funds, follow the above steps to get to our live chat queue - our agents will try our best to assist you with the offboarding.

**5. Trading system and other account issues**

● Spot, margin &amp; futures trading

● P2P disputes

● Binance Visa Card transactions

● Unable to complete KYC

● Any other issues

**Please follow the format stated above, your case cannot be escalated if you do not follow this process and your comment may be removed. Following the format helps us classify and identify the issues, escalate them to our relevant departments and get everyone’s problems resolved.** ***Spamming the feed is unfair to other users and will result in a ban.***

2022-01-19 12:07:12,"Binance Launches New 'Auto-Burning' Protocol for BNB to Replace Existing Mechanism The largest crypto exchange by far is Binance. Despite some regulatory hiccups in the past, the cryptocurrency exchange platform was trending in the news following its developments. Here was the most significant trend. In December 2021, the[ development of Binance](https://www.blockchainx.tech/bep20-token-development) officially announced the implementation of a new finance coin auto burn protocol to replace its current quarterly burn mechanism. This pointed to more “transparency and predictability” for their community.

Cryptocurrency exchange Binance implemented its first-ever Binance Token ( bnb) auto-burn program last quarter. according to the Auto-Burn procedure, remote more than 1.6 million BNB tokens are worth 750 million dollars in circulation.

The latest quarterly burn included an additional 6,296.305493 BNB. This was effectively burned through the Pioneer Burn Program, the tweet added.

### taking the different road

This was a major update. Until last month, Binance delisted BNB tokens on a quarterly basis based on the revenue it generated over a period. But, now, the exchange has implemented a new procedure, called BNB Auto-Burn.

The BNB Self-Recording Formula calculated the number of tokens withdrawn from circulation based on the BNB price. This reflected supply and demand as well as the number of blocks produced for that quarter. The BNB Auto-Burn system takes into consideration the following formula:

Here, B is the amount of BNB to burn. N is the total number of blocks produced on the Binance Smart Chain during the calendar quarter. P is an average price of BNB against the US dollar. K is a constant value as a price anchor, initially set to 1000.

Chang Peng Zhao (CZ), Co-Founder and CEO of Binance opined :

*“The implementation of BNB Auto-Burn is the next natural step in the BNB journey. It will help the BNB community grow by providing greater autonomy, transparency and predictability.”*

[Binance development](https://www.blockchainx.tech/bep20-token-development) started BNB fire in 2017 after the launch of the token. At that time it committed a total of 100 million BNB, that is, 50% of its total offer. Fast forward now, the graph looks like this:

Overall, the exchange destroyed nearly 35 million tokens through quarterly burns to date.",-0.994763195514679,0.13517807949626132,0.4347927325200052,0.09,0.037,0.874,0.9497

It is a blockchain application where we will be able to consult with AI about our health, current problems and the like. We will also be able to consult with doctors from all over the world online through the app.

Also everyone registers in the system and generates a certain number of coins. The ecosystem is supported by the medical data of millions of people and products from the pharmaceutical industry. Coins can therefore be used to pay for medical products and services, and holders can take full benefit of their bank accounts without having to carry cards.

In simple terms, we will receive most of the company's services for free, which for me is a real surprise.

Before making the transfer from Binance, the page asked me if the wallet to which I was making the transaction was compatible with the Binance Smart Chain network, so I started to investigate if Coinbase (which is the wallet that I started using) was compatible with this network, once verified through the application (attached screenshot) and on a Coinbase page ([https://help.coinbase.com/en/wallet/getting-started/what-types-of-crypto](https://help.coinbase.com/en/wallet/getting-started/what-types-of-crypto) \-does-wallet-support) I decided to carry out the transaction of the tokens, after a few moments and with the nerves that something would go wrong, the transaction is completed. I go to my Coinbase wallet to realize that nothing was found, and in my desperation I looked for any information that would be useful to me to solve this problem and nothing has helped me, I contacted Binance support and they told me that they did not know I couldn't do anything about it because of how the blockchain system worked and that it was irreversible, I also contacted Coinbase support and they told me that they don't work with the BSC network, and that I should have made a minor transfer before sending all the tokens, after that they stopped responding to me and when I opened the link that I had attached, I realized that they had banned my ip from the Coinbase help page (attached screenshot), after that they did not give me any other answer or the situation.

I had no choice but to use a forum like reddit (I've never made a post before) to find out if there is any solution to my problem, it may not be an exorbitant amount of money lost and it was my fault, but We are human and we all have the right to make mistakes. I leave you the data of the transaction and the information that I think may be important. Thank you very much in advance.

2022-01-24 12:54:00,"Binance bullying me into homelessness. Their blatant disregard for my life is appalling. Original was posted on /r/Cryptocurrency. This sub does not allow crossposting so here is the copypasta. 

Hey guys, my situation sucks. I’m posting here in hopes that it can get resolved quicker. Already received an eviction notice and started packing. Here’s what happened:

Tried to withdraw coins about three weeks ago to pay rent, like has been the case for a long time. Nothing unusual. Upon trying to withdraw, I got an email saying “Due to unusual activity on your account, your withdrawal function has been temporarily disabled.” 
Hold up. What? There is nothing unusual about this at all. The note left on the withdrawal on Binance says “risk control” … Bruh. My withdrawal was $1,100. Nothing risky or alarming about that. I’m just trying to pay rent. 
… 

Contacted CS, begrudgingly complied with all of the requests. Had to record the videos multiple times because every CS rep i spoke to kept giving me different instructions. etc etc. fast forward to me talking to a specialist and … they tell me 30-45 days until my withdrawals are unlocked. what? dude, how am I supposed to pay rent? 
..

Kept contacting CS, opening new tickets, etc, in order to see if this can get expedited. Over the next 20 days, I have spoken with at least 15 different entry level CS reps, 7 different specialists from “the escalation team” … all for them to tell me the same thing. “Thank you for your understanding and patience blah blah blah have fun getting evicted dude” 
..

How am I supposed to be patient or understanding when I have done absolutely nothing wrong? How am I supposed to be patient when I’m about to get evicted because Binance is bullying me for no reason? Despite me showing an incredible sense of urgency by contacting Binance so much, this has not gotten handled any faster.
..

I was fully compliant with every request, despite the fact that I was doing nothing wrong. The amount of things that have happened to me over the past year have broken me down, and i’m about to lose it. I keep getting kicked when i’m down. Looking for reasons to keep living, and this isn’t helping. Ending up on the streets because Binance is bullying me and won’t expedite my case is not making me want to keep living. I can’t even afford to get mental health right now, because all of my funds are locked up!!! for no reason!!!
.. 
after moving to a new country for work, my job closed down, girlfriend left me, dog ran away… dude this sucks. i have no more family back home, no where else to turn… no reason to keep going. if I end up on the streets soon because a big company bullied me into homelessness.. i’m just going to lose it i swear. 
..

If anyone from Binance sees this that can help me out… here’s my original case number: 

Case ID #81715082

Here’s the second case number, after I rage closed the original case after a the seventh or so specialist told me they couldn’t do anything for me and I just lost it:

Case ID #82151139

I don’t know how much longer I can keep going, especially if I end up on the streets in the next few days. I have full transcripts from these cases where I am begging and pleading , obviously in a bad state of mind , for Binance to do something to expedite these cases … nothing. “Thank you for your patience and understanding.” …

2022-01-24 13:31:09,"Binance is bullying me into homelessness This sub doesn’t allow cross posts, so here is the copy pasta from the original thread in /r/cryptocurrency


Hey guys, my situation sucks. I’m posting here in hopes that it can get resolved quicker. Already received an eviction notice and started packing. Here’s what happened:

Tried to withdraw coins about three weeks ago to pay rent, like has been the case for a long time. Nothing unusual. Upon trying to withdraw, I got an email saying “Due to unusual activity on your account, your withdrawal function has been temporarily disabled.” 
Hold up. What? There is nothing unusual about this at all. The note left on the withdrawal on Binance says “risk control” … Bruh. My withdrawal was $1,100. Nothing risky or alarming about that. I’m just trying to pay rent. 
… 

Contacted CS, begrudgingly complied with all of the requests. Had to record the videos multiple times because every CS rep i spoke to kept giving me different instructions. etc etc. fast forward to me talking to a specialist and … they tell me 30-45 days until my withdrawals are unlocked. what? dude, how am I supposed to pay rent? 
..

Kept contacting CS, opening new tickets, etc, in order to see if this can get expedited. Over the next 20 days, I have spoken with at least 15 different entry level CS reps, 7 different specialists from “the escalation team” … all for them to tell me the same thing. “Thank you for your understanding and patience blah blah blah have fun getting evicted dude” 
..

How am I supposed to be patient or understanding when I have done absolutely nothing wrong? How am I supposed to be patient when I’m about to get evicted because Binance is bullying me for no reason? Despite me showing an incredible sense of urgency by contacting Binance so much, this has not gotten handled any faster.
..

I was fully compliant with every request, despite the fact that I was doing nothing wrong. The amount of things that have happened to me over the past year have broken me down, and i’m about to lose it. I keep getting kicked when i’m down. Looking for reasons to keep living, and this isn’t helping. Ending up on the streets because Binance is bullying me and won’t expedite my case is not making me want to keep living. I can’t even afford to get mental health right now, because all of my funds are locked up!!! for no reason!!!
.. 
after moving to a new country for work, my job closed down, girlfriend left me, dog ran away… dude this sucks. i have no more family back home, no where else to turn… no reason to keep going. if I end up on the streets soon because a big company bullied me into homelessness.. i’m just going to lose it i swear. 
..

If anyone from Binance sees this that can help me out… here’s my original case number: 

Case ID #81715082

Here’s the second case number, after I rage closed the original case after a the seventh or so specialist told me they couldn’t do anything for me and I just lost it:

Case ID #82151139

I don’t know how much longer I can keep going, especially if I end up on the streets in the next few days. I have full transcripts from these cases where I am begging and pleading , obviously in a bad state of mind , for Binance to do something to expedite these cases … nothing. “Thank you for your patience and understanding.” …

**Step 1**

Convert btc to other low fee coins like BCH(fee = $0.30) or LTC(fee=0.10)

**Step 2**

Withdraw it to a multi-chain wallet that has swaps and low withdrawal fees

recommendations are the bitcoin dot com wallet it has low swap fees

**Step 3**

Withdraw to the wallet of your choice 😀

Most beginners don't know this and end up paying a portion of their investment to transfer fees

First, you remove the trading pair of Leveraged Tokens on short notice and tell us in a private chat that we can sell in future in better NAV value not to worry, that you only halted trading, for now.

Now, I see this Notice that the Multiple Leverage Tokens will be Cease Redemption too. Seriously??? 

We have invested so much money into Binance Leverage Token and now you cease Redemption. 

This is just unacceptable to us as Investors in Binance. We are not happy at all. This is a Daylight loot you are doing in the open taking away the money we have invested. 

Do you expect us to sell the Tokens right now when prices of all crypto have fallen and at total loss??? WTF!

We want this decision to be reversed immediately. We need an option to redeem the token at a better NAV price value in the future. We will not accept this daylight robbery. Just not okay.",-0.9999899864196777,-0.03113095238095238,0.4755357142857143,0.057,0.09,0.853,-0.8555

First, install Binance Chain app on your ledger from Ledger Live (in 'Manager').

Then, gather all your BNB in your Binance Chain Wallet, on the Binance Chain Network (address starting with 'bnb', blockchain referred to as BEP2). If you've done so already, then skip this bit.

1. ensure you have the Binance Chain Wallet (BCW) chrome extension installed.. if not, set it up
2. now move your BNB to that wallet:
   1. if from binance exchange, then may as well use BEP2 network directly. To do that, on BCW, top side, select 'Binance Chain Network' and your address will begin with 'bnb'.. copy and paste it in the withdrawal address on the exchange (ensure selected network is BEP2!).
   2. if from defi's, then on BCW select 'Binance Smart Chain', copy the ERC20 address starting with '0x', and send everything there (from Pancake Swap and etc.)
3. from BCW, send your BNB in Binance Smart Chain to your BEP2 address starting with 'bnb'. A message will appear saying 'Note: Cross Chain Transfer to Binance Chain', which is perfectly fine.

Now, ensure that BCW is on 'Binance Chain Network', then click on account (the square in the upper right corner), and then on 'Hardware Wallet'.. Follow the shown instructions (easy), and your Ledger BEP2 address will be displayed (you'll have to pick one)! Copy it.

2022-01-29 22:02:43,"Feel like this binance grid liquidation is wrong or is it?  I opened a LONG leveraged (20X) grid trade position on PeopleUSDT about a day ago on Binance.

The position was doing ok, over night it seemed to really go bullish and today it was 'volatile' the value of People went up to 0.07+.

Here is screenshot of the position:

https://preview.redd.it/26sz4867mne81.png?width=796&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6ea5bfe3c2d883c7059f484832366a8b2da0b051

 So according to my understanding.. At no point after opening the position did the value drop below the Stop Loss or Range I set. No Take Profit was set. (Ive just opened a new PeopleUSDT grid position and noticed the Liquidation Price is shown under Running grids and is below the Stop Loss.)

So I was in profit on this...and would still be if the position had not been liquidated.

I also received this push notification:

https://preview.redd.it/1ze6tjz8mne81.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e627549549ab24d8af4237a846dbebe5678a05b

 So here is what i dont understand.... This sort of push notification normally you get if say a Long position value had dropped to a level where the money you invested would not cover the trade....as in near the margin. But on my grid trade the the price was no where near the lower margin....

I opened the grid at 0.05250, the value never reached anywhere near that on liquidation.

The value of People from time of opening and time of liquidation, was always between the range i set and way above the stop loss.

So is this normal?",-0.9999939203262329,0.06969696969696969,0.4545454545454546,0.058,0.111,0.832,-0.8676

It's been a fun few years, but you're now no longer friendly to the UK, having let the regulators pile in. 

First we couldn't send bank transfers, then we could no longer use our credit cards. Now debit cards are falling off a cliff one bank after another. It's clear the regulator is removing all on and off ramps with fiat, which is fine.

Having gone through AML and KYC in the past with Binance, the UK regulators now request everyone in the UK do so again, which means Binance slowly but surely become heavily centralised and regulated by stealth to the point of a regular banking account, and will undoubtably continue to do so as governments pile in.

I am from ES Europe so please don't mind my bad English. Keep in mind it all happened last week and i am trying to have a refund from Binance and my order dispute is still in process. This scammer used Transferwise as payment method.  Let me explain the whole process. 

Once you have your P2P sell ad online you will receive an order. The buyer will send you a screenshot saying that transaction will take one business days and if you are ok with it. If you say yes, they will start the transfer and send you the receipt. After a while, you will receive an email from fake TransferWise support saying that a transfer has been received and is being deposited into your account but they will need additional verification in order to complete it. (this is the SS of that email [https://imgur.com/a/kAp46IQ](https://imgur.com/a/kAp46IQ) ) Once you share your ID Card images they will ask you to allow additional time and after a while you will receive an email saying that "" Verification successfully completed, the funds has been received to your transwise account and your wallet will be updated within one working day, this is due to inter-country policy on transwise. "". And on top of that when you login into your Wise account the transaction will even show there as being received but it will be asking you to complete verification which in your understanding you already did so you wont take any action and will go and release the USDT to buyer/scammer. Now you will be waiting for deposit to show in your balance but it will never arrive because after you released the USDT the buyer will cancel the order from its side. This all will happen in one day so please be aware. 

In my case, the order amount was 5000 Euro. The fake email I received has even Wise as its name and also the logo of Wise as their Profile picture. The fake email address is [transwisecustomerservice@gmail.com](mailto:transwisecustomerservice@gmail.com) . Lucky for me the scammer didn't withdraw the amount and Binance disabled his account for any withdrawal due to order dispute. Binance support is asking me to wait 2 more days to see if they can force the response out of buyer who is still denying these allegation and also not providing any proof. If Binance team can escalate the request, this is last chat Case# 82671528 .

**Shill text:**

While most cryptocurrencies over fluff, promise what they can't deliver, and pull rugs like they're bed sheets, ShitCoin does not want to follow in those footsteps. Instead, the goal of ShitCoin is to be the comedian; Shitcoin is only delivering the same Shit that other currencies are promising: which is A Shitty Medium of Exchange, and make your own damn NFTurds.

ShitCoin was created to be an end-all meme coin driven by its own community, for investors looking to hop on the ShitRocket to the moon. While many may see the actual token as useless because it is classified as a meme coin, the reality is that ShitCoin will provide the exact shit that it says it will, without the pretentiousness. Because ShitCoin is like the comedian, and the industry is just full of jokes, ShitCoin can constantly evolve to parody the current trash coins, becoming the ultimate meme.

The difference between other shit coins and THE ShitCoin is that general shit coins claim to be the next leader, but are shit. THE Shitcoin claims that it is shit and it delivers exactly what it claims to be. It is the ultimate shit coin. In short, it's an honest coin.

The creator is completely doxxed and has renounced ownership, and owns only the dev wallet. 1% of all transactions are directed to the dev wallet. This wallet will be used to fund exchange listings. We are still small, but has a Social Media presence on Twitter and Reddit. The toilet paper is a must-read and it’s on the ShitCoin website ShitCoin69 .com.

Shitcoin also passes every token sniffer test, 99/99 on DEXTools, are audited and seeking Legal Opinion letter when NFTurd utility release

Current Price is around 1 penny at a 250k MC. There are a limited 21M Shitcoins, with 500k already burnt.

2022-02-01 20:29:29,"Need Help with Binance New Upgraded Verification process Hi,

I am based in UK. I'm already verified with binance before I got this new notification. So why binance asking me to re-verify when I already have verified status before, I gave them my passport &amp; details before so why Binance asking me to do the same verify process again? Seems suspicious, has Binance been hacked where the hackers stole all the customer KYC information like passports &amp; driving licenses so Binance asking for them again?

I clicked on notifications on the binance site to complete this re-verification and get the following on screen:

'***Assurance Review Failed. Based on our Terms of Use and Internal Policy, these features are not available for your account.'***

***'Review time: 20 days'.*** Button next to it is greyed out displaying Unavailable so I cant even re-verify so what is going on?

Lastly are these emails legit?: [do\_not\_reply@mgmailer2.binance.com](mailto:do_not_reply@mgmailer2.binance.com) &amp; [do\_not\_reply@mgmailer.binance.com](mailto:do_not_reply@mgmailer.binance.com)because I two received emails from binance saying in email click to re-verify by 11th Feb deadline!

2022-02-01 23:03:01,"Beware !! A New P2P Scam on Binance. Hi, i am a Binance P2P trader and recently i got scammed of 5000 Euros by IDK some Nigerian or Mongolian person. I am from ES Europe so please don't mind my bad English. Keep in mind it all happened last week and i am trying to have a refund from Binance and my order dispute is still in process. This scammer used Transferwise as payment method. Let me explain the whole process.

Once you have your P2P sell ad online you will receive an order. The buyer will send you a screenshot saying that transaction will take one business days and if you are ok with it. If you say yes, they will start the transfer and send you the receipt. After a while, you will receive an email from fake TransferWise support saying that a transfer has been received and is being deposited into your account but they will need additional verification in order to complete it. (this is the SS of that email [https://imgur.com/a/kAp46IQ](https://imgur.com/a/kAp46IQ) ) Once you share your ID Card images they will ask you to allow additional time and after a while you will receive an email saying that "" Verification successfully completed, the funds has been received to your transwise account and your wallet will be updated within one working day, this is due to inter-country policy on transwise. "". And on top of that when you login into your Wise account the transaction will even show there as being received but it will be asking you to complete verification which in your understanding you already did so you wont take any action and will go and release the USDT to buyer/scammer. Now you will be waiting for deposit to show in your balance but it will never arrive because after you released the USDT the buyer will cancel the order from its side. This all will happen in one day so please be aware.

In my case, the order amount was 5000 Euro. The fake email I received has even Wise as its name and also the logo of Wise as their Profile picture. The fake email address is [transwisecustomerservice@gmail.com](mailto:transwisecustomerservice@gmail.com) . Lucky for me the scammer didn't withdraw the amount and Binance disabled his account for any withdrawal due to order dispute. Binance support is asking me to wait 2 more days to see if they can force the response out of buyer who is still denying these allegation and also not providing any proof. If Binance team can escalate the request, this is last chat Case# 82671528 .

If any of my fellow Binancian has any question, please comment and i will respond as soon as possible. Be SAFE and AWARE of Scammer.

&amp;#x200B;

**Update**: As per Binance rep, they cannot transfer my USDT from Scammer Account by themselves, they need his authorization and Scammer is telling them he will be transferring the Euros to my Wise account. So now we are stuck in cycle in which i have to wait 48 hrs and then only ask for updates. So my USDT are stuck in Scammer Account and Binance can do nothing about it even if an year has passed, while scammer is there enjoying Euros in his account.",-0.9999710321426392,0.1570869990224829,0.5592864125122191,0.104,0.05,0.846,0.9869

I just deposited a little BTC from my cold wallet into Binance. Now, I want to try a few different financial products. I also bought a little P2P BTC with Interac E-transfer in Canada. There was no fee, but the spread was really high, I calculated around 5-6% difference between the market price of BTC and the cheapest trade sale available in CAD. It's by far the biggest spread I've paid. 

* Why do people pay these high P2P spreads? 

I am looking into Binance Earn, just to see what it's like, what it can do. I like the idea of enhanced (APY %). Double digit yields. 

I only have BTC and a few stablecoins. And only have CAD$ (can't fund that in Binance).

Last years I staked 1 ETH and I got BETH as reward plus daily reward. Also Binance restricted my account because of my nationality caused by FATF and US sanctions. That's why I could only transfer my assets to another wallet from Binance, but I can't transfer that 1.0298 BETH anywhere because I have no access to any wallet supporting BETB token. That's why I request Binance to refund it as ETH so I can transfer it, they promised to do it last month (February 2022) but they didn't and now after 50 hours of chatting they say refund will be sent at the end if this month. If I didn't need the fund I could have waited, but I really need that fund because of a problem that's hurting me now. So please share your idea and help me with this issue.

I uploaded my bank statement (with the new address) several times but that got rejected. No reason given. I am assuming it was because my bank statement has my first and middle name initials and then last name (like, A B Cxxxx) while my name on Binance does not have my middle name (and it goes like, Axxx Cxxx).
I then tried verifying it using the internet bill of old address thinking I’ll change address at a later date but a screenshot of that address was rejected too.
Apparently I have to post a photo of a hard copy of a utility bill or a pdf bank statement and now I am at a loss.

It would be nice if verfied accounts don't get the notifications, because it's making me anxious that I've missed something.

The only thing I can see to do on the verfication page is to ""increase limits"" on fiat withdrawal or deposit, which isn't something I want to do, becuase I don't need to increase the limits.

Am I missing something??

In the ""Binance - Privacy notice"" which was last updated January 12 2022 it states:

### 8. What Information Can I Access?

You  can access your information, including your name, address, payment  options, profile information, and transaction history in the ""Your  Account"" section of the website. 

However, I can't seem to find this ""your account"" section of the website. 

While speaking to support in the app, with regards to the verification stuff, I was advised I need to provide a bill / reciept etc as proof of address, despite the fact that I have no button / option / otherwise on the ""Personal Verification"" page to engage / provide any of this. The page simply states ""verified"" and ""completed""

Support said they are ""looking into it"" and following that I asked where I could find my personal information, to which I was told:

""I apologise for the inconvenience, you cannot view sir it's for security purpose. you cannot see their own details""

which is total bullshit and from what I understand unlawful - not to mention a direct contradiction of the privacy policy. The policy does also state that I have the right to request any of that information:

### 9. What Rights Do I Have?

If you have any questions or objection as to how we collect and process your personal information, please contact [dpo@binance.com](mailto:dpo@binance.com).When you consent to our processing your personal information for a specified purpose, you may withdraw your consent at any time.In addition, **subject to applicable law**,  you have the right to request access to, correct, and delete your  personal data, and to ask for data portability. You may also object to  our processing of your personal data or ask that we restrict the  processing of your personal data in certain instances, by contacting [dpo@binance.com](mailto:dpo@binance.com). 

So, before I look to push this further, I was wondering if any one knows where I can view my previously provided personal information?

I can request this via the above email if absoloutely required, but given that the privacy policy states I can access this on the website, I should be able to

**Common problems &amp; solutions**

**1. Crypto withdrawal suspended**

● You receive a message saying ‘withdrawal suspended due to risk control’ and have been trying to unlock your account.

● Don’t worry, your funds are SAFU. Our agents will try their best to help unlock the withdrawal - please coordinate with our team and provide relevant information when prompted to do so.

● Withdrawal Risk can be triggered by a number of reasons. Risk control is extremely important. Please note that we can only help you if we deem your case to be legitimate, if you have attempted to hack an account and request for unsuspension, you will be unsuccessful as we have processes in place to prevent this.

Our team works extremely hard to resolve these issues as soon as possible and some cases can take time to resolve but please keep in mind the reason for this is to ensure you, our users, are safe.

**Cases replied by our mods are already in the escalation process. A longer wait after escalation = our team is working hard at investigating the issue.** If there are any updates to the case, our agents will reply to you directly in the chat.

Please refrain from leaving multiple messages in this thread if your case has already been escalated.

**2. Security issues**

● Report hacked accounts and funds.

● Difficulty to reset 2FA and gain access to your account.

**3. Fiat deposit &amp; withdrawal**

● Fiat (not crypto) is taking longer than expected to arrive in your bank / Binance account.

● Involves intermediaries such as bank transfers or buying crypto with credit/debit cards.

● *Note: It can take up to several working days for the money to be credited to your accounts.* [You can find more FAQ here](https://twitter.com/BinanceHelpDesk/status/1391776637071478787)

**4. US persons accessing old Binance.com accounts for offboarding &amp; withdrawal of funds**

● Your funds are SAFU. If you experience issues with withdrawing remaining funds, follow the above steps to get to our live chat queue - our agents will try our best to assist you with the offboarding.

**5. Trading system and other account issues**

● Spot, margin &amp; futures trading

● P2P disputes

● Binance Visa Card transactions

● Unable to complete KYC

● Any other issues

**Please follow the format stated above, your case cannot be escalated if you do not follow this process and your comment may be removed. Following the format helps us classify and identify the issues, escalate them to our relevant departments and get everyone’s problems resolved.** ***Spamming the feed is unfair to other users and will result in a ban.***

[https://www.binance.com/en/price/pulsechain](https://www.binance.com/en/price/pulsechain)

They raised over a billion for a new blockchain called PulseChain back in July-August 2021.  The developers are still finalizing everything and are working on PulseX the Dex for the Pulse blockchain.  The new blockchain mainnet is supposed to be going live and trading in roughly 1-2 months.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Why is Binance already listing a coin that hasn't even been released yet?
2. This indicates Binance analysts are following this pre-release and are openly letting others know this. Why? Are they planning to list it upon launch?
3. It also indicates Binance saw it as a marketing opportunity to put up the pages on Binance and CoinmarketCap, a website owned by Binance, to get traffic from the interest in the coin: [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pulsechain](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pulsechain/)
4. It's currently on 13,700+ watchlists on your website CoinMarketCap.  That seems like a lot of portfolios!  Is that enough to list it when it launches? My guess is most people don't go through the trouble of signing in to add coins to their watchlist, so there is likely even more interest than that.

Cryptography is a safe engine of growth. Some regard it as a hoax, while others see it as a genuine possibility to make money. It all relies on your thought and freedom of choice, in my opinion. You could attempt and fail, or you could try and fail but not expose the opportunity.

I just got aware of a new trend in the cryptoworld. I'm referring to competitions. They called out to me. I wished them well. But the dread of losing out won out. When I learned that the prize pool was almost a million dollars, I began to have my doubts. Last year, I became acquainted with an intriguing business called LOT.TRADE, which piqued my curiosity with its promotional and slogans like ""tournaments for all levels of traders."" They didn't guarantee millions of dollars in awards, but rather thousands of dollars and even prizes for the finest performances or anything along those lines. The biggest advantage was the availability of a live list of outcomes. Everyone, including those who were skeptical and did not participate in the event, could watch the combat.

On top of that, there are free access, private tournaments, and master competitions for anybody who is interested. These gentlemen have stated that they would be hosting one-of-a-kind tournaments with higher rewards and competition. Meanwhile, they will issue a certain number of various grade NFTs, ensuring participation in these tournaments, up to 55% APY(!) and, of course, a share of the prize pool.

The bank said that they were used to these kind of issues with binance and that I should just wait it out a few days, but now my account is in overdrawn and my bank will charge me for it.

In my binance account the balance is 0, and in the transaction history i find the the withdrawal with the status completed, but the money they charged back is nowhere to be found.

I proceeded to appeal said withdrawal because i dont know any other way to get in touch with support.

This is not a P2P transaction, it was a direct withdrawal in fiat to my bank account via my card, not SEPA.

2022-02-19 23:24:23,"Arbitrage Binance / WazirX Hi, im just got into the whole topic of arbitrage trading 2 days ago. The last 24 hours i have done a lot of research but its way harder than i thought to actually execute proper arbitrage trades. Then i remembered hearing about arbitraging in different regions/markets (for example europe and korean or indian markets) as the rates are can be very different. I start with indian exchanges and found WazirX, Bitbns and CoinDCX. For the first test i looked at ICP. Here my (theoretical) maths without!! looking at trading or withdrawal/deposit fees. For the example i use 1000 USD:

My trading path:

1. On Binance, buy 1000 USD worth of ICP for 19,45 USD each = 51,41 ICP
2. Send it to WazirX and sell it for 78.771,94 INR what equals 1054,73 USD
3. Then i have 78771,94 INR that i somehow have to convert to USD or anything else that i can actually use.

I thought: Great this should work fine. But now the weird part:

WazirX has the pair ICP/INR as well as ICP/USDT. The prices in this exact second (they do not match the prices of my example above, that happened about 24 hours earlier):

1. ICP/INR = 1585,90 INR what equals 21,23 USD
2. ICP/USDT = 19,88 USDT

So what am i missing here? How is the difference between the two pairs so big? So in this case i would have to sell the ICP. So i did the same math with BNB and came to the same result. WazirX INR prices are way higher than the equivalent USDT pairs.

1. Binance: 1 BNB = 399,40 USDT = 29.828,95 INR
2. WazirX: 1 BNB = 31.466,18 euqal to 421,32 USDT
3. BitBns: 1 BNB = 31.748,17 INR euqal to 423,10 USDT
4. CoinDCX: 1 BNB = 31.400 INR euqal to 420,44 USDT

I still cant believe that this is correct and i feel like i am missing something. Otherwise this would be arbitrage heaven. Please someone wake me up and tell me where i went wrong with my thoughts.",-0.9988848567008972,0.03866666666666667,0.30519999999999997,0.065,0.032,0.903,0.928

Also, it will introduce new and advanced new capabilities in the near future. Under the new name BNB Chain, the chain has in fact become a governance part.

The Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible, multi-chain-supported Binance Smart Chain simply referred to as BNB Smart Chain is still abbreviated as BSC.

This simple mistake costs me major negativity in a lot of aspects of my LIFE. It sucks but mistakes do happen and when it does all you have to do is analyze it properly and know how you could learn from it. Also, you can try to find a way into fixing that mistake you made. Well, for me as you could see at the title of this post. I looked everywhere online but it seems like none of it works for my situation but most likely I am not doing it right. Anyway, I will type what exactly happened to me. First of I am a new account holder for Binance and I've always used Blockchain exchange or Coinbase exchange. So evening I decided to do a little Gamblin Session. I decided to try out this particular site my friend recommended to me. It was a cryptocurrency online casino. After signing up I decided to use my Binance account to deposit into the casino. Eventually after an hour or so I had won enough about 1600 USD but it was in the TRON cryptocurrency. I decided to withdraw 80% of it into my BINANCE exchange through the TRON address. I was able to do it without any problem. Now I converted all of my cryptocurrency into BNB coins including all of the other cryptos I had in my Binance account. I decided to transfer most of it, all of the total cryptocurrencies into my Coinbase wallet application. On my Coinbase wallet app, I searched for BNB and I saw BNB coin and pressed receive. I copied the address then finally went to my Binance app and initiated a withdrawal. Before I finalized the withdrawal I was at the part where there are different options to choose from of which network I wanted to use. Mistakenly I choose BEP20 as for the network. When the withdrawal was finalized I realized the mistake that I had made. I should have chosen the ERC20 network. To come to think of it I think that is a mistake also if I did such thing. Anyways, this was the mistake that I made. I need help with retrieving the funds. Please reply here or pm me. I am willing to send you some ETH for any person that can help me all the way. THANK  GUYS. The total BNB I currently lost is 828 BNB. Anyone who helps me with this can have 10 ETH.

I can report that, I do not yet own a private island or a yacht, but it was really fun building it and didn't make my daytrading any worse lol. I have open sourced the extension so you can play around with it yourself. Maybe it'll make you into a literal trading GOD - maybe it'll bankrupt you, who knows. 

If you want to run the extension you would need to go to ""Manage Extension"" and click ""Load Unpacked"" and then select the root folder of the Repo. Feel free to inspect the source code first, and if you like the idea, you can submit and PR and help develop it further.

However, I don't understand why there is an interest rate component.

&gt;Binance uses a flat Interest Rate, with the assumption that holding cash equivalent returns a higher interest than the BTC equivalent. The difference is stipulated to be 0.03% per day by default (0.01% per funding interval since funding occurs every 8 hours) and may change depending on market conditions, such as the Federal Funds Rate.

2022-03-09 19:53:11,"PSA: UK Customers, Binance Claiming You're in the USA. Locking Your Account and Losing Your Money Binance are using whois data to locate IPs, as many ISPs around the world buy ranges of IPs (netblocks) from the states, this means that they are logging UK users as coming from the USA.   


Because of the different regulations, they will then block your trades and trading account and tell you to register at [Binance.us](https://Binance.us) \- which is obviously wrong.   


You might be getting one of these warnings when you login:  


&gt;Your IP address indicates that you're attempting to access our services from a restricted jurisdiction that Binance does not provide our services to. We apologise for any inconvenience cause.

or   


&gt;Dear user, as we perform periodic sweeps of our existing controls, we recognize that you are trying to access Binance from a US IP address. Please note that as per our Terms of Use ([https://www.binance.com/en/terms](https://www.binance.com/en/terms)), we are unable to service US persons. If you are a US resident or citizen, please register for an account at binance.us  


**There are two ways around this:**  


1 - Contact your ISP and pay to have a static IP in a UK registered netblock and risk keeping your crypto in Binance  
2 -  Get everything out of Binance and use another exchange  


After 2 weeks with binance support they are still telling me to login/out and to delete the cache. This has NOTHING to do with it. It is THEIR system using an unreliable location lookup method. I switched to a UK registered netblock and everything works flawlessly (and they are STILL telling me to login/out delete cookies)  


**How to find out your situation**  


When you login from a new/other device, you might get an email saying new login detected from .... location: El Segundo, California, for example. Obviously you're not in California  


Use google to ""what is my IP"" and write down your IP (you can usually see the location on a map with these services which will show that it is in the UK)  


Go to [https://whois.domaintools.com/](https://whois.domaintools.com/) and you can put in your IP, this will show you the range it is in (the netblock), who owns it (your ISP) and where that range is registered. Here you will see a match with what Binance claims.  


This is why Binance think you're in the USA, because they are using unreliable methods to locate IPs.  


Now you can request a static IP from your ISP in a UK registered block (this is important to specify). This can take 10-20 minutes depending on your provider and you will need to reboot/reconnect your router.  


Repeat the steps above to A: Confirm you're now in a UK registered netblock and B: Prove the problem is with Binance",-0.9999828338623047,0.12544677544677543,0.6071872571872572,0.028,0.052,0.92,-0.8885

So, guys, how do you feel about where the NFT is right now? Despite the fact that I would say there is great momentum, it appears to me that just a few obvious and proper steps are necessary for it to really become one of the most popular issues in the world (although without my thoughts, NFT seems to be doing well, of course). In NFT, I'm seeing a few distinct patterns. Gaming NFT, 18+ NFT, and interactive NFT are all examples of this (in addition to a bunch of other things). As long as the majority of NTF's admirers are young adults, their interests will likely stay firmly rooted in the NTF universe.

Many of you, I believe, are already aware that these regions need more development, which is now underway. New and young initiatives are already able to handle this challenge, however it's not without precedent. It has been said that ""passion transcends the body and causes desire..."" The yearning for cryptocurrency is so strong that we want to mix our passion for crypto with erotica to produce 10,000 ""crypto muses,"" or muses of protest. This is how the project's creators define it, and as you can see, there are 10,000 distinct 18+ NFT. They're attractive to me. They're attractive, but they're also energetic. It's almost like you're looking at a set of real-life models.

2022-03-12 14:32:53,"Did Binance lose me $10,000? I've heard horror stories of people losing funds when depositing to the wrong network on Binance. However, in this specific instance I did everything right when depositing BNB to Binance on the Ethereum network. The problem is that once received to the Binance wallet, the BNB was for some reason converted to WBNB which is not supported on the Ethereum network. 

Obviously, I should have sent a smaller amount first to test. No need to remind me of that. Really—if you're thinking of commenting that I should have sent a smaller amount first as a test, I'd like to ask you a favor and please refrain. I already know. 

But aside from that, this was not my mistake. I properly sent BNB from MetaMask to Binance on the Ethereum network to the correct address.

I'm now on my third deposit recovery application right now after my first two were rejected. I really hope the current application is successful, but I'm considering the options for if it is not including some legal action. 

Here's how it happened. 

On 18 February, I swapped 3 ETH for BNB within MetaMask (which was about $10,000 USD at the time, which is why I use that figure in the post title). Here's that BNB swap in MetaMask: 

https://preview.redd.it/jwh1mm4wxwm81.png?width=306&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=55b4041fc5f21aa0c65ac462779cd193c9c405dc

I then found out that I could not use the BNB on sites like PancakeSwap, since the BNB now in my MetaMask wallet resides on the Ethereum network. 

I looked at Binance and saw that there is the option to deposit on the Ethereum network. Here's what the notice says: 

https://preview.redd.it/gs4clm12xwm81.png?width=330&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cebfb9b35e2c86ef8fe7b3564d2987c55c00dcd2

So I figured I'd send the BNB to Binance where it would be converted to the mainnet, then send it back to MetaMask. 

https://preview.redd.it/8rw6nmyhxwm81.png?width=522&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e36fc7f5ff98154ead1bcf8673df80545365f9f9

I copied the address and sent the BNB as instructed. I carefully checked that I had the correct coin, network and wallet address. 

Now again, I know I should have sent a test amount first. Hindsight is so great, right? But the reason I didn't was because I had already successfully sent plenty of ETH using the EXACT same method and wallet address. I didn't think of it as a new kind of transaction, even though I obviously should have. 

Within MetaMask, the transaction appeared like this: 

https://preview.redd.it/2tubo2o5ywm81.png?width=315&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=033faa6af205fef5daf85098e910513b2acbfde8

After a few minutes the worry started to set in. After a few hours, I knew there was a problem. 

I immediately submitted a deposit recovery application. After 2 days, the application was rejected stating that I had claimed the wrong coin, and the correct coin was WBNB. This was honestly the first time I ever heard about WBNB, I had no idea what that was before. 

https://preview.redd.it/tnx3z0r7zwm81.png?width=465&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d2325f97bca6178e24a14c70475189b108bc539f

So, after doing some research and learning about WBNB, I submitted a new application to recover my WBNB from the Ethereum network the same day. A few days later, I got a notice from Binance asking me to ""resubmit materials,"" which turned out to mean they wanted to know the wallet address to send the recovered funds, which I provided. After that, the application entered the status ""Processing funds,"" with a notice that it could take up to 30 days. I was fine with that. I could wait. 

Then today suddenly, I got notice that Binance is ""unable to handle your Uncredited Deposit Application."" The application details have only the remarks ""collection failed.""

https://preview.redd.it/uvzqdxgx0xm81.png?width=459&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fcb7053b696b74c44eba7271b0f275cf6683aadb

[Here is the wallet](https://blockchair.com/ethereum/address/0x410628909443d9968553c66d69b53822cc64fc48) which I sent what I was certain was BNB to. It shows a balance of 21 WBNB, which is the amount I sent (under the impression that it was BNB). This address is obviously dedicated to my Binance transactions, because the only other transaction there is also mine, an ETH transfer to Binance. That same wallet address is still the same one Binance asks me to send deposits to them (though I doubt I'll be doing that), meaning the wallet is open and active. Binance holds the wallet and private keys, and is perfectly capable of accessing the wallet. This means they are perfectly able to recover the funds, even if it won't be easy or fast. Binance has proven many times that when they want to do something, they do it. 

What I'm saying here is, I don't buy the argument that it's impossible to recover the funds. 

I even have the watch-only wallet to keep an eye on it: 

[The funds are right. There.](https://preview.redd.it/1k3gmvsm3xm81.png?width=321&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=702172f623eadec68be5c39e0843371f7344fe48)

Anyway, I've got the third application open now which I hope somehow resolves. Meantime, I'm preparing other avenues of contact and getting legal advice on my options. I'd appreciate thoughts on this, and also I wonder where in the process what clearly appeared as BNB in MetaMask turned out to be WBNB?",-0.9984114170074463,0.08777140827922077,0.45264390557359313,0.103,0.058,0.839,0.9921

World no.3 crypto exchange FTX was the first crypto exchange to secure a license in Dubai**.** Both exchanges will now operate their regional businesses from the port city.

Binance had said in December it was cooperating with the Dubai World Trade Centre Authority to set up a blockchain hub in the city. Today’s license is likely further progress to that end.

Earlier this month, Dubai passed its first ever law to regulate the crypto sector, and formed a regulatory body for virtual assets. Bahrain also recently introduced banking regulation for cryptocurrencies.

Hey guys, I know this probably gets posted a lot but I need something to possibly calm me down. I have over 4m in my Binance account and I randomly received this message when trying to withdraw. ( I know there's fake accounts that will try to message me, but I'm on a throwaway and not dumb)

My withdrawal got rejected and made me do a face scan, no problem. Did that and it said withdrawals has been enabled again. I tried to do so, then received another error saying it's been disabled and rejected due to ""risk control"". I have not changed my IP, device, or even an increase in size of withdrawal. I am willing to provide any information that they may ask.

I'm currently in queue with a ""specialist"". I'm wondering if anyone else had these issues recently randomly? I'm curious if it's something I did.

I have been waiting for about a month for a specialist to respond to my live chat, yet absolutely nothing...

Long story short my father had a Binance account for numerous years. He recently tried to login after years and was unable to since they detected he is connecting from the US. He just wants to take out his funds and send to a US exchange. What exactly are the steps? We can't even contact Binance since when you click support on Binance it says we can't use support since connecting from American IP.

I do have SurfShark VPN, should I try connecting from a EU IP and try with cleared cache? Just trying to figure out best way to take out funds as my dad has a good 10-15k funds in there which was many years ago so maybe they have grown since then.

Also, my father now has Coinbase so can we transfer out to that or should we open a [binance.us](https://binance.us) account to get funds?

 I am wanting to join binance to trade crypto currencies. I have some questions before I join. Thanks for your time and help with this.   


What are the fees.  
 

I see you charge maker taker for spot trades  
 By spot trades does that mean a trade using limit order / stop Limit or instant market buys or both?   


I see you charge an instant buy sell fee.  
 Is that if you buy sell using current market price, without using limit order stop order?   


If I use limit order do I pay an instant sell fee as well as a maker/taker fee or do you just charge a maker taker fee for a limit order?  
 

I'm based in UK.  
 How do I deposit funds into binance?  
 And what are the fees for making a deposit, and what ways can I use, eg transfer?   


What do you charge for making a withdrawal to a bank in GBP?   


Can I transfer bitcoin from coinbase pro to binance and is there a fee?   


I see you offer 25% off fees if I use binance coin to pay fees. Is that 25% off a limited time offer or for ever?   


Also I see people offering 20% off fees if I use their referral. Is this legit and will I get the 20% off fees?

One week after leading a $4.5 million seed investment in Ultiverse, Binance’s venture arm is betting another $5 million on the metaverse gaming startup.  

Binance Labs, the crypto exchange’s venture capital and incubation unit, announced its initial investment in Ultiverse in a blog post published on March 18. DeFiance Capital co-led the raise, with Three Arrows Capital and SkyVision Capital also investing. This initial $4.5 million raise took the form of a sale of Ultiverse’s governance token MXS.

But now Binance Labs has chosen to invest another $5 million in the equity of Ultiverse, according to both companies. Nicole Zhang, director at Binance Labs, told The Block that the additional investment was made to ensure the firms are “bonded in a way that we have some sort of a say in terms of the team’s future path.”

Binance Chief Executive Officer Changpeng Zhao is visiting El Salvador and plans to meet President Nayib Bukele.

Mayorga said Zhao's visit was a vote of confidence in Bukele's decision to adopt bitcoin as legal tender last September, as well as its plan to issue bitcoin-backed bonds.

Zhao praised El Salvador for taking on a pioneering role in the adoption of bitcoin and said Bukele's presidency would be remembered in ""heroic"" terms for its bold bet on the future.

The country's adoption of bitcoin has been beset by public skepticism about the cryptocurrency, which has depreciated substantially since hitting a record high in early November.
I can remember IMF faulting El Salvador for accepting Bitcoin. The envy that IMF felt then.

2022-03-27 23:13:38,"Binance card missing refund &amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So i rented a car in february and it was returned the 6th of march. Everything went well, the car rental company made a preauthaurisation of 1200$ and when the car was returned charged me 516$ out of that (i know it's not a refund technicaly but i will keep refering to it as refund)

&amp;#x200B;

First problem when i dealt with pre autaurisation with my regular cards it takes few days for the money to be back on the account, in this case after few days i opened a tchat with the binance support service and they told me it will take at least 21 days. Quite an unpleaseant surprise but i thought ok not the end of the world.

&amp;#x200B;

Sadly last friday i discovered that the 1200$ preauthaurisation went from ""paid"" to ""completed"" on binance and i even received a 2% cashback on the entire 1200$ so i opened a case with the support service i provide a copy of the car rental contral, plus the bill of 516$, the same day i also went to the car rental company spooke to the manager, and she gave me a copy of both merchant receipt the 1200$ preautorisation and the 516$ charged. I provide both to the support service also.  The reply was it will take us 5 days to investigate and for our money to be refunded.

7 days later, i received this reply from the tchat ""specialist"" :  

""Update- ""I have checked and there is no record of the refund, the sender would need to trace this

They would need to provide the ARN number which would confirm the refund has been received on our side""

&amp;#x200B;

So despite all the documents provided and the situation explained that it was a car rental and a preauthorisation, their so call ""specialist team"" call that a refund wich is not because the 1200$ never left the account, by extension their is no ARN number because thats not a refund. I pointed that to him, he never replied anything, so i have to open again a new case.

&amp;#x200B;

I went again to the car rental company yesterday, and she got her accountant explained the processed on an email to me with again the supporting evidences of both step (picture attached).

[Pretty straightforward process right ?](https://preview.redd.it/5qkxsv8ypyp81.png?width=1458&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed21ffbfa8a4f497ffb8d5c3b898b8d7f3b20c37)

&amp;#x200B;

I open a new tchat yesterday providing the case number, got transfer to a ""specialist"" again , the delay is supposed to be 12 to 24h, 36hrs later im still waiting.

&amp;#x200B;

So to conclude: their so called specialist are clueless, they have no control whatesoever to whats going on and the provided proof in the tchat were completely ignored.

&amp;#x200B;

When you are offering a debit card you should have a basic support service for it specificaly, which binance doesnt have.

&amp;#x200B;

PS: i have been using the binance card before for regular payments, never had an issue. But considering the numerous complaints on binance card refund and missing money if one day you have an issue it will be painfull as hell to be solved

My account was hacked on the 17th of February as i received an email of an attempted USDT withdrawal of my whole portfolio. Luckly the automatic system had rejected the withdrawal and my withdrawal and trading functions were temporarily locked awaiting for my KYC to be provided .
I connect with customer support immediately asking what was happening and of course they started to copy paste procedures to me. Unable to talk with a decent customer support ( the Bot does a better job at listening to you ) , i secured my account according to their SOPs and provided with the required KYC.
I also told them that i would have withdrawn to my bank account in Euros ( which is the only way i have ever withdrawn since i opened the account ) once they would have lifted the lock on my functions.
I managed to verify my account.
However , shortly after , I was receiving messages on my phone of somebody else successfully adding P2P method of payment , so i contacted support straight away but NOBODY was there to answer me.
Despite following their securiy protocol , despite having 2fa , kyc verified account , enabled extra security measures like changing email , password and enabling mobile verification, the hacker was still in my account and managed to add P2P method ( how could they allowed them to do it ? My account was even KYC verified since many months back ) and withdrew all of my balance ( = life savings ) . Binance justified it by saying that the IP used was similar to mine ( let's not forget that not too long before it alerted the automatic system ).
Binance told me that the case should be reported to the police and foward the report to their law enforcement department , which i did on the 18th of February and again after 1 week because nobody at customer support was able to tell me if the had received the report or not. I contact them almost every day : they were saying sorry for what happened and then putting me on hold for 6 hours so that i could speak with the ""specialist"" , eventually to have the same reply: contact us after the weekend ( law enforcement is off ) , then after 3 days , then after some days. Endless tickets opened and put on pending with no reply.
I can say that up until now , there was NO response from Binance law enforcement . I cannot open a legal case against anybody because i have no information to provide the police with. Information that Binance has.
I started to follow up the case with my lawyer and the answer that my lawyer received was that i am the sole responsible of the safety of my funds and that no report was sent to the law enforcement department. I feel hopeless and extremely disappointed by what it is considered the best exchange in the world. Best at not caring about your funds. If I can save at least one person from what i went through , that would be already a victory .

These are great opportunities for PancakeSwap to get more users and grow its reach. Its partnership with Binance is great for the community as a whole.

The integration of defi in the  binance ecosystem will lower the barriers to the defi space and bring more adoption and volume to defi projects like cake, sushi , and alohadefi, espicially from users who are new to the space.

This January, seven former Binance core techs launched a free crypto exchange called Mayex. Mayex provides Free Spot Trading, USDT Margin Perpetual Contract and Coin Margin Perpetual Contract. There are Over 100 crypto trading pairs on this platform.

When Mayex was established, it was determined to be a subversive of traditional exchanges. Mayex’s vision is to make every transaction more profitable and become the most competitive crypto trading platform. To this end, Mayex is completely free for spot trading, and the derivatives trading rate is as low as 0.01%. The team redesigned the entire trading engine based on the experience of “the Binance” , it supports non-stop hot updates and multi-level risk control. Test results show that the new engine can support 400K orders per second.

John Davis, one of the co-founders of the Mayex, joined Binance as a technology executive after more than six years of quantitative trading. He mentioned:

“The whole crypto trading industry is quite suitable for high frequency trading. However, the cost of crypto trading is too high. Our goal is to allow users in this industry to enjoy faster, safer and lower-cost trading.”

We shared these ideas with our former colleagues and we all decided to work together to create a new trading platform to make it happen, and we have done it.

2022-03-30 12:54:51,"Binance futures are actually CFDs… First, let’s talk terminologies here.

Futures refer to contracts whereby a buyer agrees to buy an asset at a set price at some future date.

Quarterly futures will expire, and the seller will be obligated to sell the asset, while the buyer is obligated to buy it on expiry.

Perpetual futures are ones in which you don’t have any preset expiry, and the buyer can choose to execute their option whenever they please, and the seller has to oblige.

CFDs, ie: contracts for difference are contracts derivative of the assets (meaning they extrapolate their price from them) and whereby a buyer and a seller agree to pay only difference in price, depending on which way the price goes, without ever owning or even remotely involving the asset. 

If a buyer goes long, and the price rises, the seller has to pay the difference.

If the price falls, the buyer pays the seller the difference. 

But no asset exchange takes place. 

I noticed that when Binance futures expire, no asset is ever transferred.

Furthermore, a seller that opens a short position has no obligation to buy the asset and provide it to the buyer. 

The only thing that happens is the price difference gets paid in the denominating currency of the transaction…

Therefore, can we all agree that Binance Futures should be renamed Binance CFDs?!",-0.9809904098510742,0.012499999999999999,0.43229166666666663,0.075,0.043,0.882,0.687
