2022-01-01 00:32:09,"Not to toot my own bugle, but 16 months ago, I had created a thread when Bitcoin was $12000, and enumerated the reasons it was a very bullish asset then. I had also made a rough prediction/estimate of end of 2021 price of $40k, which isn't too far from what the price is today. Here is that [thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/iiec4v/why_i_am_still_bullish_on_bitcoin_after_hodling/). It was pretty well-received. And most of the points in it still hold. The following are some new developments since that thread.   


* Tesla has become a net holder/buyer of Bitcoin, which makes it the first top company to do so. And it holds/buys ONLY bitcoin, no other coin. Elon Musk has also indicated that he holds quite a lot of Bitcoin ( and that he plans to buy more perhaps, but not sure about that). 
* Bitcoin became the national currency of El Salvador, apart from the USD. 
* Lightning network continues to develop, and gets used, specially by Strike. 
* New futures based Bitcoin funds were launched and approved in USA.

All these events are again huge positive signs, which continue to make Bitcoin an attractive asset. I expect Bitcoin to double every year, that's my rule of thumb. That's why I was able to 'predict' 18K for end of 2020, and $40k for end of 2021, which are both pretty good 'predictions'.

If they did understand how to manipulate the psychology of the horde, all they would need: is a couple handfuls of individual entities, pick a time to do a steady bull-run to get people to fomo in, once the money is coming in, since they then have such a better grasp of how the market is going to act than the majority of us, the whales can judge where the top should be with much greater accuracy than you or I. When the market gets close to top, they each take their profit. Domino liquidations crash the price further, and all the people who FOMO'd get rekt, your wealth just got (hopefully temporarily) redistributed.

Solana seems to have a lot a good features and is gaining more and more market share but  I worry about its inflation potential since I've heard (please correct me!) that BTC is the only coin that actually can practice inflation aversion while all other 'altcoins' can only talk about it but history has shown that they all succumb to centralization and inflation due to that concentration of power.",-0.6628273725509644,0.29670138888888886,0.6236111111111111,0.142,0.058,0.799,0.9603

2022-01-02 02:01:19,"Different Bitcoin investing strategies  Let’s keep those god-awful TA charts and drawings and patterns aside. Let’s list some easy to remember and follow approaches to BTC

1. Frugalypse Now - 2 jobs, bread &amp; butter, rented house, 1 mattress. 24x7 fiat mining. You take all the pains now, for good gains in the future as you buy bitcoin nonstop. It’s not too late!
2. Miner Bro - You like to go against the current. Current wisdom says it’s more profitable to buy bitcoin than mine it, but you put it all in 1 or more ASIC miner and you do whatever it takes to run that shit coz tomorrow BTC is going so high, that these machines will be pure gold, and you’ll have one already running.
3. Smoked Out - You quit smoking and just put the amount you spent weekly on smokes into buying sats.
4. True HODL - Never selling, so never registering a loss, always stacking sats whenever in the mood or when possible.
5. Time Bomb HODL - Setting a timer for a long-term future definite sell date, preferably over 3 years as no one who has held for 3 years has ever had a loss.
6. The New Year Party Fund - Allocate what you just spent (last year) between Dec 25 and Dec 31 for Christmas and New Year’s to buy all the BTC you can on Jan 1 this year. Sell it on Dec 25 this year. Repeat year after year to party beyond your means.
7. BTC Savings Account - Convert your bank savings account to BTC, treat BTC as your new savings account, adding money to it when you can.
8. Inflation Buster - This one is especially for the money-bags and the filthy rich, who see their notes getting stale in a deposit vault or earning peanuts in the stock or bond market. Put most of it on BTC and beat the printer that goes BRRRRRRR.
9. Meme Magic - You’re in it for the ride, you don’t really care about the profits, so you have the most fun and zero stress. When the memes are at their highest and you see a kickass meme, you drop in some munneh just to comment “haha I just bought some”.
10. Negative Gravity - As in 2019, when you need to pay the bank to store your money, whatchu gonna do? Call inflation buster BTC!
11. USD Hater - You just want to see the USD PetroDollar burn so that no more wars can be fought, so you buy and promote BTC as much as you can.
12. Drive-By Buyer - Buy with all the cash in your wallet whenever you walk by a BTC ATM.
13. All In - Sell everything you can and collect all the fiat you can to go all-in in one stroke.
14. The Hourly DCA - Spend like 69 cents or dollar 1 with auto-buy every hour or day or week.
15. Sharp Dip Sniper - This requires patience and vigilance. Keep your USDT (or USDC or any other stablecoin) ready on the exchange to snap up the discounted BTC whenever it goes into a sharp decline before it pulls back to the regular curve.
16. BTFD - Keep fiat or USDT ready, but don’t buy. Whenever the market tanks and people are saying Bitcoin is dead and FUD is at the highest, then you buy the f dip!
17. Fear &amp; Greed Index - Buy when Fear, Sell when Greed
18. Adopted Influencer - Just follow 1 influencer you trust (if you can find one!) and do whatever they say, even if it sounds illogical.
19. Interest Hunter - Borrow fiat on low interest and earn higher interest yield/stake by converting it to BTC.
20. Payday Percentage - Allocate a fixed percentage of your pay to buy BTC on every payday, whether it is weekly or monthly.
21. Shitcoin Genius - If you are one of the few who know that hidden place where the most successful memecoin and shitcoin moons are launched, you put dollar 100 on those and convert the 1000s to BTC at the top.
22. Choose The Orange Pill - You’ve read enough, you convert all your other coins to BTC.
23. 2x Orange Pill - You’ve read enough, you convert all other coins and stocks and lands and gold to BTC.
24. Black Swan Songer - Keep waiting for the biggest black swan event evar, like when BTC goes from 65k to 28k in a blink and then buy buy buy!
25. All In Leverage - Gather a percentage of your bitcoin or fiat that you can YOLO, then wait for the worst FUD ever and the worst market crash ever, and then go 125x leverage on Bitcoin rising in the future.
26. Banhammerite - Buy big when China or another country bans it, or a few weeks after the ban.
27. Legaltenderite - Buy when another country like El Salvador makes it legal tender or passes favorable regulation for it.
28. Shitcoin Lottery - Becoming a wholecoiner is not possible for you, being that the BTC price is out of your reach, so you spend dollar 100 every month on a new pump and dump you discover on 4chan biz which allows you to buy early when the price has too many zeroes after the decimal. Keep playing until one goes 1000x or so, then you can buy a whole BTC!
29. NFT DayDreamer - Buy some shitty NFT and make its sell price the current value of 1 BTC in ETH OR BNB. Hope that someone buys the shit jpeg and then you get a wholecoin!
30. Time Travel - Go back to 2010 and buy 15k Bitcoins for dollar10-100 on Liberty Reserve.
31. Elon Apeing - Buy whatever Elon jokes about. Convert it to BTC at the top.
32. Saylor Mirroring - Buy whenever Saylor &amp; Microstrategy buy, they usually buy when the price is good.
33. Winklevoss Conundrum - These two chads are richer than their nemesis Zuck now thanks to Bitcoin, yet they shill a lot of shitcoins, buy/sell when they’re shilling another coin, DYOR!
34. Keiser Inverse - Sell whenever the OG Bitcoin Whale Max Keiser is going batshit crazy with antics, it is usually during the dips. Buy when he is quiet and serene on Twitter and his Podcasts.

2022-01-02 07:32:08,"You can easily run a full bitcoin node (not to be confused with a miner) using a raspberry pi and a 1TB SSD with Umbrel software Hello,

I wanted to share my experience setting up a full bitcoin node and how easy the experience was for me. 

If you have these components laying around or can afford to get a 16GB+ raspberry pi kit, USB to SATA cable, and a 1TB SSD, you can run your own full node and have access to the bitcoin blockchain without the help of a third party (ie an exchange or wallet app) as well as helping with decentralization of the network and securing your investment.

All I had to do was follow the raspberry pi assembly manual and watch a 6 minute YouTube tutorial on how to install Umbrel software to a microSD card. I'll admit I have a little more technical knowledge than the average Joe, but with a little bit of patience, troubleshooting, and a handy search engine, anyone can figure it out fairly quickly.

The process essentially involved putting together the raspberry pi, hooking it up to my internet and a spare monitor (in my case an old TV monitor), downloading the umbrel software to a microSD card on my windows computer using a USB to microSD converter (often comes in raspberry pi kits), loading the SD card into the pi, and powering on. [I did encounter a bug during the validation step when writing Umbrel to the SD card. It has something to do with the windows OS, but can be skipped during writing and isn't a necessary step in writing Umbrel to the SD card successfully. You just have to hit the skip button during the validation step when it is writing.]

This process can be very easy and I encourage anyone invested in bitcoin and wanting to participate in maintaining the network to give it a try. It's a fun and fulfilling project.

2022-01-02 10:54:27,"Some Bitcoin statistics to start the year: During 2021 Bitcoin consumed 134 TWh in total, which is comparable to the electrical energy consumed by a country like Argentina.

Related CO2 emissions were \~64 Mt; enough to negate the entire global net savings from deploying EVs.

 In 2021 the Bitcoin network handled \~97 million transactions. This equals roughly 0.012% of the worldwide volume of non-cash transactions.   Bitcoin was responsible for 0.54% of global electricity consumption. On average, that's 1,386 kWh per Bitcoin transaction. 

 The power consumed per Bitcoin transaction on average could power an average US household for more than 1.5 months.  The carbon footprint of just one Bitcoin transaction amounts to 658kg of CO2, which is equal to the carbon footprint of almost 1.5 million VISA transactions. 

It's also a bigger carbon footprint than the per passenger carbon footprint of a direct flight from Amsterdam to New York.  In total, the Bitcoin network consumed \~89% more energy in 2021 than in 2020.

I read Saifedean's book and thought it laid out some very pertinent points, and most will look back on him in a decade as being a pioneering though leader in this space.

Having said that, I've just started the Fiat Standard and also listened to some of his podcasts, and he talks about there being no data showing the increasing human emitted Co2 being linked to a speeding up of climate change, and referring to vegan diets as being ""chemical $h!tstorms"", and animals not contributing to more gases in the atmosphere that are accelerating climate change, Al Gore is a crackpot etc......basically denying that Co2 is linked to climate change.

I don't want this to be political, or anything about climate change (in terms of heated debate), I want this to be more about Ammous....but have any of you also come across this, and does this worry you at all? ""How you do one thing is how you do everything"" (I believe), and if he has come to this conclusion based on the same data that I've seen, he's wildly incorrect. Just worried about his analysis of Bitcoin now.....an economist trying to get involved with science and not having (what I can see) as a valid point. Has his assumptions of Bitcoin also been based on crappy assumptions and prejudiced viewpoints, or is that more in his lane as an economist?

Back then, cryptography was an extremely nerdy topic and cryptocurrency was not invented. The book made me think about money and information in an abstract way.

Stephenson did a great job describing the shortcomings of fiat money and physical gold. Example: (Sub plot spoiler): when they arrived at a huge pile of gold bars in the middle of the jungle, they quickly realized that it's practically impossible to turn this treasure into money or move this pile without being discovered and robbed.

The book also does a great job describing the basic principles of cryptography to the reader. It takes a trip back into the days of WWII and tell stories about the enigma machine and Alan Turing.

2022-01-02 17:12:56,"Hilbert-Huang Transform analysis on Bitcoin Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT) is an algorithm designed to extract trend and primary cycle, secondary cycle, tertiary cycle... from pretty much any signal.

It seems very suitable for Bitcoin analysis, so I wrote the code and here are some results I want to share.

**Trend**

[Trend](https://preview.redd.it/4k8kkxcc19981.png?width=747&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c237fe710bf46381cfff82bef992e0b045a95611)

The trend shows Bitcoin is constantly growing, but it starts to slow down in 2021.

&amp;#x200B;

**Primary Cycle**

[Primary Cycle](https://preview.redd.it/4yalykf229981.png?width=733&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3722f18fc4a4ab098b8335bb24013c82296f431)

The primary cycle shows that 4 year cycle is a real thing, and we are now at the top of the current one.

PS: All graphs are in log scale. If you want to get the price only influenced by the primary cycle, just multiply it with the trend. For example 1.6542\*33000 = 54589 will be the current price if the primary cycle is the only factor. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Secondary Cycle**

[Secondary Cycle](https://preview.redd.it/8w8yvper39981.png?width=758&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=301361aee73f61bf3235c73f0d9c25689562286d)

This graph shows there is a secondary cycle with an amplitude almost as big as the primary cycle but more than twice as fast. Its wavelength vary from 16 to 20 months.

The April ATH is actually caused by the peak of this cycle. This secondary cycle and the primary cycle have been in opposite direction and cancel out each other since April, this explained the sideway movement.

The amplitude of the secondary cycle seems to shrink over year.

&amp;#x200B;

**Tertiary Cycle**

[Tertiary Cycle](https://preview.redd.it/319y9v5x79981.png?width=752&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d2b0535bec2baa0eafb4d133a9d3de15fa0798c6)

So there is this 8 month cycle, its previous peak contributed to the November ATH.

&amp;#x200B;

**Cycle 4**

[Cycle 4](https://preview.redd.it/5tmicsr899981.png?width=736&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3b4637eb8ed4fb15650b39897ccdcca2cd944fce)

**Cycle 5**

[Cycle 5](https://preview.redd.it/mh32mq3mh9981.png?width=738&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b96424c5e62e9270f7e68665105af38d29568bc9)

It starts to look like noise, so I will skip them and jump to the final one.

&amp;#x200B;

**Cycle 16**

[Cycle 16](https://preview.redd.it/p92ullav99981.png?width=734&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f5e3a76eed5ce835d3c7d0018cf164118f900dbc)

This is the last cycle, wavelength several minutes, it moves the price by less than 3% most of the time.

&amp;#x200B;

One interesting thing about HHT is you can add cycles to the trend one by one to reconstruct the signal, from outline to detail.

**Trend**

[Trend](https://preview.redd.it/4k8kkxcc19981.png?width=747&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c237fe710bf46381cfff82bef992e0b045a95611)

**Reconstruct 1 (Trend + Primary Cycle)**

[Reconstruct 1](https://preview.redd.it/846ew0uid9981.png?width=743&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=247d84eba14b84ea97723c6015109f58747f9deb)

**Reconstruct 2 (Trend + Primary Cycle + Secondary Cycle)**

[Reconstruct 2](https://preview.redd.it/r9mypq0od9981.png?width=728&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a4befc573baee426279e3a0e7770fc2c1a09159f)

**Reconstruct 3 (Trend + Primary Cycle + Secondary Cycle + Tertiary Cycle)**

[Reconstruct 3](https://preview.redd.it/odckg9qxd9981.png?width=744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b885f138826a6ff5b0b1b3eb7ab309976f416fc9)

At this scale, we can clearly see the 2 ATH in 2021.

**Reconstruct 4**

[Reconstruct 4](https://preview.redd.it/jo4u6e6ae9981.png?width=743&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=43b92ef6ec054b5352186c4e2933e37ada3904c1)

I thought this was interesting but if this occurs - won't we have the same problem we already have with banks lending out funds that are not backed by anything thus contributing to devaluation of currency overtime. Further, if banks own the bitcoin, they can just abolish bitcoin eventually can't they? Or at the very least confiscate.

That leads me to my next point...What if central banks decide at first to use bitcoins on their first layer, holding bitcoin in and their custody, and lend money and then they confiscate all bitcoin, simiarly to what happened with gold. Wont then we have the same problem with money needed to be printed out of thin air?

To my understanding (please correct me if I'm wrong) in order to participate in the lightning network while having control over one's own coins, one needs to do at the very least one on-chain transaction to set up a multi-sig wallet.

Bitcoin can do about 400,000 on-chain transaction per day (about 2750 per block according to google, 2750*6*24 is about 400k).

That's about the same number has people being born every day. So by that fact alone lightning cannot scale bitcoin to a global currency.

Even in a world where no new people are born at all or wallets are always perfectly handed over to the next generation, while the number of people is not increasing and while every human only ever makes one on-chain transaction, we'd need 8,000,000,000 (people in the world) / 400,000 (transactions per day) / 365 (days per year) -&gt; 55 years to onboard the world.

2022-01-03 07:39:53,"A pro-bitcoin post I shared for r/cc’s cointest debate 
Once it is more widely accepted, Bitcoin will be the first complete currency human beings have ever had. Fiat doesn't have limited supply, gold doesn't have portability, proof of stake coins don't have durability. Bitcoin is only missing acceptability as a key component in a currency, and that is rapidly changing with increased adoption.

Even with a market cap of nearly 1 trillion dollars, bitcoin is extremely low in market cap compared to its potential. Some people expect that a sub billion dollar marketcap is the only way to make 100x, but that only relevant to coins that will top out in the billions. With the probable future of bitcoin being the worlds strongest currency, its value in TODAYS society is upwards of 100 trillion dollars (more on this later). In a future society that has had the benefit of using history's best monetary network, the potential market cap of bitcoin is indescribable.

Despite often being called 'slow' when compared to other crypto based networks, Bitcoins development is optimized. You don't need to have layer one staking or smart contracts to fulfill the purpose of bitcoin. All that needs to happen is flawless protocol defence and network uptime. The tech is simple but the importance is vast, replicate the factors of hard money in a digital space, forever.

Doing so in a decentralized manner ensures that Bitcoin is strengthened with every blow. The network is so reliable that it pays more to support it than it does to attack it. So when China bans mining, America buys asiics. When someone tries to acquire all the coins, the price chases them up. There are no individuals to prosecute so you have to attack the network head on, and market participates are enticed to learn from each attack.

This is why regulation will hurt everything else but help the bitcoin network. No matter what the technology is or who uses it, if the government has a point of attack they will exploit it. Ethereum currently won't succeed without the vast changes being implemented by the ethereum foundation. That is a vulnerability. Fiat won't succeed without the federal government. That is a vulnerability. Bitcoin won't succeed if 51% of a largely spread group of financially successful people are somehow coerced to all betray themselves at the same time. That is not a serious vulnerability.

BUT HEY! You made a lot of assumptions! What if Bitcoin doesn't become widely accepted? Bitcoin is superior at all the other aspects of money. (Durability, Portability, Divisibility, Uniformity, Limited supply). People are going to want to own it and eventually want to spend some. If you don't accept it as payment but it is popular, your competition will.

How is 100 trillion even a real number? There is more than just the money in everyones savings account. People already know that fiat can be outpaced with superior assets, and the equity market is estimated at around 300 trillion dollars today. None of those options have as many monetary aspects covered as bitcoin does.

Why would anyone new buy it if you can't yield farm shit coins? Jokes aside, the purpose of bitcoin is to preserve purchasing power, which is does almost flawlessly. Everyone is going to want this ability for a large portion of their capital eventually. Other protocols are acting sort of like a bank when they run defi. Its really you lending your purchasing power to an actor for credit. Its pretty neat but not revolutionary just because its on blockchain.

How is it decentralized when michael saylor owns it all? Two part answer. The network is secured not just by holders but by nodes and miners. Microstrategy will get large returns for taking a large risk if bitcoins price goes up, and that is perfectly fair. But as they buy more and more, it is going to cost more and more, where every other financial system in history has had some sort of corruption in its growth from unequal opportunity. As of today and as of 10 years ago, you and apple have the same purchase price.

Don't hate on ETH, why can't something newer take Bitcoins place? Other blockchain technologies are cool, and may create super awesome internet, banking and ownership applications. But none of these things could ever replace bitcoin without copying its protocol. Its set up just right for maintaining integrity over time as a currency. If ETH did so, it would just be bitcoin #2 with a lower market cap and thus less security. So other coins are not a threat at all to bitcoins future utilization/ceiling. They do take some of the speculative dollars away from bitcoin, which I think is why alts are more volatile in price.",-0.7226046919822693,0.18863244759626338,0.5196086807928911,0.173,0.078,0.749,0.9982

2022-01-03 08:35:21,"Are you ready for bitcoin to finally leave the dock on the way to the moon? Because we have barely started our engines. I see way too much bearishness in here and long term loss of hope for another bubble cycle where we 10x-20x in a year.  The macro backdrop has never been as good as it is right now, period.

Bitcoin has a hard cap of 21 million coins, when lost coins are factored in the hard cap is at most 18 million and dropping daily.  

The illiquid supply of bitcoin is 14.4 million of the existing 18.9 currently circulating coins and grew by 400k since may. ([here](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/bitcoins-illiquid-supply-continues-to-hit-multi-years-highs))

The silent generation controls ~20% of the USA’s wealth, the boomers ~55% and generation X ~20% leaving milenials 5-10%.  Adds up to 105% because I’m extrapolating lines from 2019 ([here](https://www.businessinsider.com/millennials-less-wealth-net-worth-compared-to-boomers-2019-12?op=1))

Of the millionaires polled, those controlling 90% of the money in the USA have virtually no exposure to bitcoin with gen x having 25%, boomers 4% and the silent generation wasn’t even in the poll but likely even less than boomers. Millennials clocked in with 83% participation and a full 30% had 75% or more of their money in crypto ([here](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/16/millennial-millionaires-plan-to-add-more-crypto-in-2022.html))

Every year two things will occur.  Some of the reluctant genx-boomers will begrudgingly dip their toes in, and some of them will die leaving money to millennials who are just itching to go balls deep.  So 90% of the capital out there is going to be fighting over an increasingly illiquid bitcoin supply. 

I’m [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/pm099y/daily_discussion_saturday_september_11_2021/hch7iln/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3) post I calculated a minimum 12x but more reasonably 20x multiple for incoming capital to multiply into increased market cap for bitcoin.  

90% of the money has no position and will be fighting over an increasingly illiquid supply. 

Just sit back for the next decade and do nothing.  We will see multiple million dollars per coin within 10 years.  And it is hard to grow 50-100x in 8 years without having a gang buster 10-20x in there somewhere.  

Don’t worry about any other coins surpassing bitcoin unless someone makes a run at actually being decentralized and secure.  Unless those are your #1 and #2 there is no point in making your project a crypto because it would be better as a centrally held database.  So hold on to the millennial coin bitcoin and wait for the boomers to beg you for a slice.",-0.9995415210723877,0.09903273809523809,0.3594494047619047,0.033,0.084,0.882,-0.9568

2022-01-03 10:12:45,"Bitcoin Predictions for 2022 Happy New Year folks!

2022 is here and now a lot of Bitcoiners are wondering what is in store for BTC this year. Well, Bitcoin was up 55% in 2021 and currently has a 142% 10 year CAGR growth rate. If this trend continues then we could see 100k Bitcoin for the first time ever.

Now, there are several key catalysts that could cause a massive rise in Bitcoin price so here are my quick thoughts:

1. Inflation will increase in 2022 and the smart money will continue dumping Gold in favor of Bitcoin.
2. Whales like Michael Saylor, Cathie Wood, Elon Musk, and Jack Dorsey bought a ton of BTC last year and a massive price crash would put them in the red. I don't see this happening because the rich elite are in complete control of the global asset markets. MicroStrategy holds 124k BTC with an average purchase price of $30k. So that's a massive support level in my opinion. 
3. El Salvador became the first country to accept BTC as legal tender. We will see a few more countries follow suit.
4. There will be a lot more paper Bitcoin ETFs that will go public and help drive mass adoption. If Grayscale successfully converts GBTC into an ETF, that could help drive BTC prices much higher.
5. Bitcoin is around 1 million active wallets and I expect that number to increase substantially.
6. Now that 90% of BTC is already mined, we are approaching a legit supply shock assuming long term HODLers don't sell. If BTC hits $100k then we could see $150k or $200k before another bearish selloff.

I don't have a crystal ball but there isn't a lot of interest in Bitcoin right now and we are still sitting at $47k. That speaks volumes because a lot of long term HODLers are refusing to sell, which is good for future price targets.

I believe we are still early in the game and Bitcoin is only 13 years old. 13 years is the beginning of puberty in children and I think we'll see a similar trend in Bitcoin this year. 

BTC will hit 100k and people will praise BTC instead of calling it a scam. Institutional investors will pile in and retail will FOMO in more as well. 

My strategy is to DCA 10% of every paycheck and lump sum buy on dips. Keep stacking and stay healthy.

2022-01-03 14:35:39,"We Are Year 13 After Bitcoin Network Came Into Existence. Nothing Will Ever Be the Same Again. It is January 3, 2022. Thirteen years ago today, Satoshi Nakamoto launched the Bitcoin network. A few weeks after presenting his white paper to the world, Satoshi Nakamoto made his revolutionary idea a reality. On this day, I think it is essential to wish Bitcoin a happy birthday!

This birthday is also the birthday of all Bitcoiners, and more generally of all those who want to live their lives on their own terms.

This day is also the day of the Proof of Keys. This event takes place every year on January 3rd. It is a special time when all Bitcoiners are called upon to simultaneously withdraw their Bitcoin from the centralized exchange platforms to take possession of their Bitcoin's private keys.

In the latest issue of the In Bitcoin We Trust Newsletter, I also explain why in this year 13 after the creation of Bitcoin, everything will be different: [**https://inbitcoinwetrust.substack.com/p/we-are-year-13-after-bitcoin-network**](https://inbitcoinwetrust.substack.com/p/we-are-year-13-after-bitcoin-network)

Bitcoin was created to give us a way out of the infinite vicious circle in which we have been locked for over 50 years. We now have hope for a better future world in which the people have regained power over the fruits of their labor.

A world in which we can once again have access to leaderless hard money that protects us from any kind of censorship. On this unique day, it is therefore essential to remember why Bitcoin was created, to measure how far it has come, and above all, to look to the future, because the future that awaits Bitcoin is simply phenomenal.

I did not have any meaningful savings so the only way to get Bitcoin was to work for fiat and buy every month. I buy when its up, I buy when its down. Few years went by and I was basically at no profit (during corona dip) but it didn't matter. I had a long term goal. Now it looks easy and great in hindsight. But I can tell you, it wasn't easy and you're not late. You can do the same I am doing. All you need to do is start. And keep at it. Theres no get rich quick. But there's get rich slowly.

I spent most of the second half of 2021 trying to orange pill my social circle and I only managed to succeed with my very closest friends.

I noticed that most people either don't care or cannot wrap their heads around it. It's almost like you need to have certain genes or personality type to be a Bitcoiner.

I even visited El Salvador to see it for myself. Most businesses preferred to be paid in dollars than bitcoin. I talked with taxi drivers, small business owners, etc, and they didn't understand Bitcoin. They were all afraid of the ""volatility"".

I also noticed that some people would get a little interested, ask me a couple of questions here and there, and then said something along the lines of ""*That sounds really great, I will definitely get into it*"" and then go on with their lives without getting into it lol.

For mass adoption to happen, I believe the dollar needs to actually collapse so that people look for Bitcoin as the exit. Similar to Argentinans and Venezuelans. They understand the value because they have seen their own governments destroy their currencies.

The US government will try to delay the collapse of the dollar as long as they can with all sorts of shenanigans. I think it will take at least 20 years before people in general lose complete faith in the US dollar.

In the meantime, Bitcoin will continue to behave as a very strong store of value, with a few small countries adopting it as legal tender.

2022-01-04 02:21:13,"How do you read bitcoin blockchains? Bitcoin blockchains looks very different from other cryptos I'm familiar with so I'm try to understand this better For example (I just picked a random wallet):

https://blockchain.coinmarketcap.com/address/bitcoin/1NjF5bUeJWv53BzZqXYeCqjQeiQ7YfCYST

Why does every single transaction have multiple from and to addresses? It seems like whichever btc wallet I look up, there are multiple addresses involved in each tx.

Shouldn't there just be 1:1? Like for example, eth does the following:

Wallet A = xyzxyzxyz

Wallet B = abcabcabc

Transfer 0.1 eth from xyzxyzxyz to abcabcabc

How does it work in bitcoin in terms of the blockchain? If I send from wallet A to B, why does each transaction spawn multiple addresses for from and to?

And in this example below, how much did this wallet receive/send in each tx? Super confused right now.

Currently investors buy stocks and ETFs etc to out perform inflation and the dollar losing value year on year. But as we get mass adoption of cryptocurrency if everyone sees bitcoin as a better store of value and a better investment than say ‘Apple’ or ‘Tesla’ as it’s outperformed stocks yearly, why would investors continue to invest in stocks and not just hold all their assets in crypto?

2022-01-04 16:35:50,"Wanting To Explain to a Baby Boomer What Bitcoin Is? Use This Simple 3-Step Explanation. There’s nothing better than relying on things they’ve already mastered. I’m 37 years old. My parents are 66 and 67. I am a representative of generation Y, while my parents proudly represent the Baby Boomers generation. Between them and me, there is a real generational gap in terms of technology.

When the Internet came along, my parents had a very difficult time embracing the Web revolution. Nevertheless, little by little, they did. Today, a major monetary revolution is happening with Bitcoin. For Baby Boomers, it’s very difficult to understand how Bitcoin works, what is Bitcoin, the why of Bitcoin, and more importantly, what’s in Bitcoin for them.

Beyond the simple fact that the current monetary and financial system seems perfect to them because it has allowed them to accumulate significant wealth, they find it very difficult to overcome the negative preconceptions that have arisen from the constant smear campaigns of politicians and central bankers over the past several years.

If you are in the same situation as I am, if you want your parents and Baby Boomers, in general, to stop believing that Bitcoin is just the entertainment of a few geeks, I advise you to follow the following 3 steps to explain to them what Bitcoin is:

1. Bitcoin Is Similar to Gold
2. The Bitcoin System Can Be Compared to the Way Email Works
3. Bitcoin Combines the Properties of Gold and the Workings of Email

By relying on things your parents know, you will maximize your chances that they will understand how revolutionary Bitcoin is.

In the latest issue of In Bitcoin We Trust Newsletter, I explain that in detail: [**https://inbitcoinwetrust.substack.com/p/wanting-to-explain-to-a-baby-boomer**](https://inbitcoinwetrust.substack.com/p/wanting-to-explain-to-a-baby-boomer)",-0.9855358600616455,0.02208333333333333,0.5115873015873016,0.076,0.065,0.859,0.5435

Billy Bob owes me money which is around what 1btc is worth. This person lives in a different country and bank transfer will be tricky, and in theory I'd have to report it as a gift, and pay 30% tax on it. 
I'm thinking of using BTC or cryptocurrencies to make the transfer anonymously. But I feel like the purchase of BTC is always registered. So theoretically Billy Bob could buy 1btc and send it to my hardware wallet. But wouldn't it remain somewhere that he has this wealth (his bank transfer to the btc wallet)? Unless he claims to have lost a wallet in a boating accident, but then his wallet shows activity of transferring to my hardware wallet...
Am I overthinking this? Is this risky? Any tips on how to anonymize this transfer without having to pay this bullcrap tax (fyi the money is from an investment I made through billy bob like 10 years ago and went amazingly well, the amount is actually twice as much but he pays almost 50% tax for withdrawing it.

2022-01-04 22:24:29,"Many experts have started predicting two or three more countries will make Bitcoin legal tender this year in 2022. Here is why I believe Dubai and the UAE will be next. Dubai has to be the next top contender for making Bitcoin legal tender. Here are a few reasons I could think of as to why.

1) Their currency is stuck pegged to the US dollar which with inflation rising is horrible for them, they need an alternative to use along side their existing currency.

2) They have no taxes at all so no friction in terms of adopting Bitcoin. They are not losing any tax revenue by making it legal tender.

3) Dubai loves PR and marketing itself and this would be the best PR stunt they could possibly do. The entire world would be talking about them.

4) Their population is 95% immigrant expats, and of those expats most send remittances home to their families overseas, Bitcoin would make remitting money far easier for their residents and their residents families.

5) Dubai is a tourism based economy so allowing tourists to travel there without having to worry about cash or travel cards or currency exchange desks or credit cards would make life easier for tourists who would need nothing but a lightning wallet to be able to pay for everything in the country.

6) Dubai has proclaimed themselves as being the city of the world so they should then adopt the worlds one truely global currency.

7) They have an efficient government that could roll out lightning wallet support for merchants and residents extremely fast. 

8) Dubai wants to be the worlds most futuristic city so they should therefore adopt the worlds most futuristic currency.

9) Making Bitcoin legal tender would attract the worlds fintech entrepreneurs and they want Dubai to become a technology hub where businesses headqarter their operations.

10) Their Sovereign Wealth Fund already invests in Bitcoin and the crypto ecosystem.

11) Solar powered miners in the middle of the desert with sun 360 days of the year could be a fantastic revenue generator for their government.

12) Dubai has ubiquitous usage of wifi and 4G data everywhere and every single resident has a smartphone so there's no technological barrier to adoption.

13) Bitcoin as legal tender would attract the crypto rich crowd looking for a pro Bitcoin country to live in, and Dubai always wants more wealthy residents to move there.

14) Dubai has a culture that loves Gold meaning they have a culture that truly appreciates sound money principles, so bitcoin fits in perfectly with their existing cultural ideals.

15) Dubai has a small and extremely efficient government which they are always looking to make even more efficient and more automated. Bitcoin allows instant money flows between all government departments and staff in a programmatic manner.

16) Dubai loves being the first to adopt new tech and they take pride in doing everything bigger and better than anyone else. The same will be true of Bitcoin.

I don't think Dubai would let this opportunity pass them up while places like El Salvador and other central and south American countries take all the benefits of tourism immigration and business creation. If Dubai doesnt make Bitcoin legal tender this year they are letting other countries get a huge head start on them.

I believe for all these reasons and more Dubai will announce bitcoin as legal tender before the end of 2022.",0.9852055907249451,0.21761664261664265,0.44895983645983634,0.195,0.02,0.785,0.9988

right now, I'm working on a scientific essay for my bachelor's degree.

My main topic is examining the chances and risks of the introduction of Bitcoin as a legal tender in El Salvador this year, with main focus on the positive influence on the remittance market.

I am searching for scientific source material, especially about these topics:

* Bitcoin's basic network functionality and technology in detail
* Technical basics of the Bitcoin lightning network
* Proof of work-mechanism
* blockchain technology in general

Can some of you provide some useful sources for this?  

I know where I can find some good information on this ""in general"" and I already have a good basic knowledge on these aspects, the hard part is finding books, scientific articles, papers etc. on this topic, which can be quoted in a scientific essay.

This was the main reason to mine at the time. BTC mining required ASICs by that time, and many resorted to their GPUs. Majority of other coins were considered scams or ICO P&amp;D's that proliferated on bitcointalk. 

Took an 8 year break without following any news about crypto, and all I see now are the same altcoin scams and P&amp;D schemes but with MUCH more sophisticated marketing. It is a much more dangerous landscape to be in as a new investor than when it was much simpler back in 2013/14. I see people showing their portfolios with literally nothing in BTC today. 

The future of cryptocurrency is BTC (if it means anything, Goldman Sachs identified BTC as a '[pure cryptocurrency](https://i.imgur.com/0fWdV6o.png)'), and there will be a huge reckoning when most of these other coins crash and the biggest altcoins whales will convert their coins into BTC.

Just for an example, hypotheticaly If there is 21 million bitcoins available, and if every single one of them is owed by let's say 1000 people. 
Would you be able to buy if non of them owners are willing to sell ?

Side questions: if there is always someone is willing to sell bitcoin, how does the price match up with the sell and buy? If bitcoin price (hypothetically) is 1$ at the time of sell , is that price is recorded for someone to buy?? In this case , why then transactions happen almost instantly?

this was probably early December, now i live by myself, I'm single and have no kids, I work full time, and rent a house, with the price of everything going up, I didn't have enough money to buy some Christmas gifts for nieces and nephews this year, so i went to the good people of the internet to ask for help, as embarrassing as it is, i have a few discords that I'm in that have people that are really into bitcoin and stocks, so i pledge my case, someone in there asked if i had a btc address, I was like sure? why? ""With the price of BTC i never touched it or looked into it"" so long story short I gave him my btc address and within minutes, he sent me 100 bucks and i was able to convert to usd and cash out and get some things for family, and i was just amazed. I mean that was smoother than a GoFundMe, and less embarrassing, and it just made me think how fast someone can change someone's life... I mean I love my job, i could always use a raise, but it's my life Ya know, it's what I'm used to, I make enough to pay bills, and well... that's about it.

Morally and philosophically I can also see many positives, but wonder if I’m missing something when it comes to ramifications of future widespread adoption. You’d probably call me a bleeding-heart leftie - or a “liberal” for US readers (BTW means something else to us in Australia unless you specify lowercase ‘l’). Most BTC authors and podcasters seem to be libertarian, and while I support BTC as a means to thwart autocratic regimes and surveillance capitalism, and to knobble corrupt banking systems, I don’t know where it will leave democracy overall, or how it will affect people who are vulnerable and disadvantaged. Of course these are the people currently being left behind by our increasingly oligarchical political systems. But will things become worse for those already worse off? As I said I’m not a libertarian and do support big government - but government with true democratic values, truly ‘of the people, by the people, for the people’. ie nothing like that being offered by eg the US Republican or Democratic parties today!

2022-01-05 06:30:21,"Bitcoin (BTC) Back of the napkin valuation for the coming capital reallocation  Ok, so I read [this](https://www.wsj.com/articles/nfts-and-snl-crypto-keeps-burrowing-into-the-mainstream-11640567423?mod=saved_content) WSJ article that states that ""About 16% of the U.S. population holds or has held cryptocurrencies, according to Pew Research Center.""

For a frame of reference, the % of U.S. population that is invested in stocks has been about [55%](https://news.gallup.com/poll/266807/percentage-americans-owns-stock.aspx)

So, if the thesis of crypto comes to fruition, and it becomes its own asset class, we are likely to see a large scale capital reallocation over the coming years. Potentially, upwards of 39% (55-16) of the U.S. population will have some exposure to the new asset class.

39% of the U.S. population is about 128,700,000.

If each of those investors has about [$30,000](https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/investments-by-age-americans-non-retirement-2020-3) in investments, and reallocates 20%, or $6,000, we have a $772.2 BILLION capital infusion into the ecosystem.

Lets just say 50% of that money goes into BTC within 5 years. That's $386 BILLION, or 43%, of the current network value for Bitcoin (@ 890B). A now total network value of 1.276 TRILLION.

Furthermore, lets assume that 40% of bitcoin are being held as investments or otherwise dormant, meaning that 60%, or roughly 12,400,000, bitcoin is free floating.

(1.276T / 12.4M) This reveals a BTC price point of roughly $102,903 at the end of this capital reallocation time frame, equivalent to a 120% gain from the price point now of $46,673

This means every sound money advocating gold bug who doesn't believe in bitcoin doesn't really believe fiat currencies will fail. They just believe a financial crisis and high inflation similar to the 1970s will cause people to buy gold before things are fixed and humanity continues with fiat. 

All they want to do is sell gold and profit from that price rise, they don't talk about a new financial system all they talk about is golds price movements. They don't really want to help the world transition to a new sound monetary system they just want a profitable low risk trade, and they absolutely hate bitcoin because bitcoin has already had the price rise they wanted to see for gold five times over.

2022-01-05 15:25:39,"Bitcoin cycles theorem - speculation about extended cycles. Hi all!

As we all know BTC had cycles based on ""halvings"" on average 4 years. It is all about reducing BTC supply to miners till all BTC (21 millions - not including frozen coins) will be mined fully. There is a model created by Plan B called STF (Stock To Flow - more info here [https://medium.com/@100trillionUSD/modeling-bitcoins-value-with-scarcity-91fa0fc03e25](https://medium.com/@100trillionUSD/modeling-bitcoins-value-with-scarcity-91fa0fc03e25)) which presents it perfectly.

And here is my idea.   
1. What if BTC cycles extend in time from cycle to cycle (because halvings have less impact on the entire circulating BTC supply).   
E.g. first time it was 3 years and 9 months, then  3 years 11 months, maybe now it will be 4 years and 6 months for cycle?

2. What are the outcomes of prolonged cycles?

It is going to be more flattened (ups/downs from cycle to cycle won't be so sudden. This will explain why we had so much consolidation this year, and not a high pick in December.

Ofc supply is limited, so the long-term direction is to go up (to the moon). Maybe that is why is it not too clever to predict the bubble end and next bubble beginning to maximize income but just HODL?

Or it is just bubble end and I try to find some explanation 😃

2022-01-05 18:02:02,"This is why Netflix can and should accept lightning network bitcoin as a form of payment. Lightning is essentially anonymous and it is specifically designed for small transactions. This means the general population who just live their lives requiring small transactions have complete financial privacy similar to cash. Meanwhile on chain transactions are monitored similar to the banking system.

As far as I can tell this is an ideal way to manage things. The 1% of people undertaking the largest transactions in an economy are scrutinised and held to account by everyone while the 99% are left alone.

In the same way no one questions the source of your cash when you pay to buy things even though it's anonymous, people should never have to question the source of your lightning network bitcoin. Take Netflix for example, they sell gift cards to pay for their service yet they have no idea if the cash used to pay for that gift card was stolen 5 minutes ago or not. The same should be true of lightning network bitcoin. Netflix should be able to accept lightning network bitcoin for their service without having to worry about the source of the funds they are receiving.

For small anonymous transactions using cash peoples innocence is always assumed, the same should be true of lightning. For large transactions that take place inside banks or on chain there is oversight in the form of anti money laundering protocols and on chain analytics.

Whats my point? Netflix should accept lightning network bitcoin as a form of payment. Netflix already accepts forms of payment like credit cards, using your phone credit balance and selling gift cards for cash. Accepting bitcoin via the lightning network should absolutely be an option too.

I hate to buy Bitcoin from exchanges inside India as there is constant threat from Govt to wind up their business. Recently there were meaningless roumers regarding the same there was huge panic selling that Bitcoin was actually available at discounted rates compared to global prices on Indian exchanges. I have a feeling that this happens because Indians can buy or sell their crypto to only Indians. But I am not sure how exactly are these Indian exchanges bringing liquidity from. 

This may be far fetched thing but if Govt indeed does something foolish about regulating the currency or banning it, then the only option for Indians would be to sell crypto to Indians who also maintain wallet outside India and naturally since supply will be more than demand we might have to sell our crypto way below global rates in that scenario. 

I do not want to deal with Govt regulation nonsense and simply buy bitcoin from exchanges outside India or Global exchanges and hodl it forever using my INR.  How can I do that? What are my options.

You know, if we embraced dumbing stuff down for the masses, we’d probably reach a lot more people, instead of trying to act like an angry Econ professor who's scolding them for not understanding the fundamentals after a lifetime of being raised to be clueless on this subject.

I get that there are people here who hate the way he phrases things or uses metaphors, thinking they that can make better metaphors to help people understand Bitcoin. 

Well if you think that way, then good! Make those better metaphors and post them here! We need all the dumbed downed explanations of Bitcoin that we can get to reach the masses. We're not even at 2% global usage yet, so we need simple ways to explain it to the other 98+% of the world's population that has yet to try to get to know Bitcoin. 

So if you're inspired to write a better metaphor than Saylor, then do it and post it. Hopefully it is better and it helps new people coming to this sub read a nice simplified explanation on Bitcoin that they can understand.

2022-01-06 00:54:11,"How to get free bitcoin by playing games? Here's the answer! I want to introduce you RollerCoin, a site where you can earn some bitcoin for free!

&amp;#x200B;

**What is RollerCoin?**

* RollerCoin is an online Bitcoin mining simulator game, which rewards you with Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Dogecoin (DOGE), Binance Coin (BNB) and RollerTokens (RLT). As part of the game, you build your own virtual data centre to generate power. This “virtual power” then allows you to mine real satoshi coins, ETH and DOGE. Compete with friends to see who can earn the most!
* The core idea of the game is a distribution of the block reward between players depending on their mining power – just like with real Bitcoin mining.

**How much can you make RollerCoin?**

RollerCoin will not make you rich but in long run, you may be able to make extra income from it if you are committed to it, last I check the leaderboard, the person on top played for 18months, and is estimated to be earning around $1500 worth of crypto a month!

**How to play?**

Once you sign up and create an account, you’re able to create and customize a little character. Don’t worry, if you don’t like how it looks now, you are able to change it later on. Your character will be put in a room with a small computer next to them. To start generating power, the user must play minigames that can be found under the “Games” tab. Each game will provide you with mining power (in Gh/s – GigaHash/second). Additionally, users can generate power by completing tasks or purchasing stationary miners with Satoshi (either mined through the game or purchased).

If you sign up using [my link](https://rollercoin.com/?r=ky08gzvy), you will receive 1000 Satoshi for free! This can help you purchase your first rack!

Currently, there are 10 minigames (that generate power) to choose from, including:

* **Coinclick** – A user must click on coins falling from the sky. Be careful not to click the bomb!
* **Token Blaster** – A space invaders style game. The user must shoot little aliens without getting shot
* **Flappy Rocket** – Similar to the flappy birds game. The user must guide a hamster through a maze only using mouse clicks.
* **Cryptonoid** – The user must break the bricks or “hashes” to earn points.
* **Coin-match** – Most similar to the classic Bejewelled. Match 3 or more coins in a row.
* **Crypto Hamster** – The user must jump a hamster up a screen, landing on pads, and avoiding aliens.
* **2048 Coins** – Title the table each direction to match coins. One new coin is added for every slide.
* **Coin-Flip** – Coin memory! The user must match pairs of coins to earn points.
* **Dr.Hamster** – (not shown in the picture above) Tetris style.
* **Token Surfer** – (not shown in the picture above) A game where you skateboard over a mario type landscape collecting tokens.
* More that are coming soon!

Once a game has finished, the user can “Gain Power”, which will pass on the points as Gh/s to your miner. 

Each game has 10 different difficulties, and 3 steps between each difficulty. This means that you need to pass the game 3 times to move up in difficulty. Rewards change depending on the difficulty. Each day the games will reset back to level 1. 

Once you have hit level 10, you can keep playing to earn more Gh/s for your miners

Each 5 minute period, a new block will be released. That block will be shared amongst all of the players in the group. The players with the most miner power, will gain the most Satoshi. Time will change (increase or decrease) depending on pool power, but will be reset back to 5 mins regularly.

The overall reward per block can be changed each 1000 blocks, but it depends on the power, activity and number of miners.

Your individual power in relation to the cumulative power of all players will determine how much of a share of each block you will get.

If you choose not to play games, you also have an option of buying racks and miners. You must have a rack to be able to purchase a miner. Miners are able to produce Gh/s for you automatically, and they don’t run out of time. However, miners cost satoshi (either the satoshi you mine, of if you choose to deposit satoshi / bitcoin). The miners available also only provider a much smaller amount of power than what the games provide. **BUT** the power that the miners produce does not expire!

Started running my Full node yesterday following the [https://bitcoin.org/](https://bitcoin.org/) instructions and I am not sure whether it is supporting the network. I went to this website [https://bitnodes.21.co/#join-the-network](https://bitnodes.21.co/#join-the-network) but it said my connection was ""unreachable"".

And after Bitcoin's bad start to 2022, Microsoft, Apple and Tesla have also beaten BTC in the past 12 months.

When it comes to investing, it's hard to quibble with an annual return of 60%.  And yet Bitcoin holders earned lower yields in 2021 than one of the Web2 companies that crypto is trying to overtake: Alphabet.

Bitcoin had a lackluster December, limping into the new year with 60% returns for 2021—its worst performance since 2018, when it lost roughly three-quarters of its value. (Investors can only hope for a down year like that again.) Though BTC has a $880 billion market capitalization, ranking eighth on CoinMarketCap's list of assets, in between Meta (FB) and Nvidia (NVDA) shares.

But Alphabet, which has a market cap above Bitcoin's, nonetheless managed to beat it. Google's parent company watched its stock price rise 68% in 2021, per data from Google Finance, thanks to increased advertising revenue across its platforms, including YouTube.

Other top-tier tech stocks also did well. NVIDIA, which makes chips for both video game devices and crypto mining rigs, gathered up 125% returns as supply chain problems boosted demand (and prices) for its products; its market cap is now above $750 billion.

Computer company Microsoft is up 54% over this time last year. Apple has registered 41% gains. And electric car maker Tesla, headed by Dogecoin fanatic Elon Musk, is now up 64% over the past 12 months.

While cryptocurrencies and companies are different types of assets, comparing the numbers is instructive precisely because of their differences. Many stocks (though not Alphabet) pay regular dividends to shareholders.

Moreover, stocks—even individual ones—can be incorporated into retirement accounts, meaning they have in-built tax benefits that make them more attractive to retail investors. Not so with Bitcoin, hence the demand for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund that trades like stocks on a traditional exchange. 

Of course, holders might object that these numbers are cherry picked—home in on another timeframe and the numbers might look completely different. After all, Bitcoin is known for going on epic tears.

* kazakhstan infrastructure struggles to manage
* gets power outages all winter long
* gov't is forced to ban bitcoin as well
* illegal mining keeps taking place which is still putting strain on kazakhstan's energy infrastructure

It is just the market correcting itself.

For any asset the price cannot keep continually increasing \[if it does then it's probably a scam\], it needs to adjust from time to time, which is why bitcoin sees frequent price dips.

As such times the best thing to do is HODL your coins or buy more, but *never panic sell*.

If you are a newcomer this is a perfect time to buy some bitcoin.

Top exchanges include:

* Binance
* Coinbase
* Crypto.com
* Kraken
* Gemini

All of the above require you to submit KYC details and are mostly centralized entities. Nowadays it is almost impossible to find an exchange that is fully decentralized, since exchanges deal with fiat money alongside crypto, regulations compel them to collect personal data. 

In addition, since these exchanges are custodial, they can freeze anyone's account and assets without any notice.

Other options to buy bitcoin:

\- Decentralised Exchanges: No KYC, but liquidity may be an issue especially for certain regions. 

* Bisq

\- Bitcoin ATM

\- P2P platform: Peer-2-peer platforms that connect buyers and sellers, they too require KYC.

* Localbitcoins
* Paxful

I'm struggling to see how this would not be the same in a fully Bitcoin system.

For example, if someone took a loan of 0.1 btc to buy a piece of land. Then the economy grew and there was an increase in output in goods and services to the extent that now your btc enables you to purchase more of the same goods and services. In this example there is deflation. But does this not hurt the person taking the loan e.g. The land is now 'worth' 0.05 btc due to the increased purchasing power of Btc. In this circumstance the borrower is now worse off.

Companies etc. rely on debt to grow a business or produce new productive technology.

I must be missing something here. But can anyone explain how this situation is avoided I.e. Borrowers being worse off due to Bitcoins increased purchasing power which then would discourage people from getting loans to produce new tech etc.",-0.9841217994689941,-0.023251748251748253,0.318006993006993,0.06,0.119,0.821,-0.9175

2022-01-07 00:21:32,"XPDI - The bitcoin miner that sells shovels during a gold rush, the AWS for crypto with $200M profit in 2021 and $44.9M revenue last month I know that the SPAC landscape isn’t doing very well right now, I am trading SPACs since FMCI and I see a lot of good and bad companies going public. I believe Core Scientific/XPDI is the most attractive investment you can make at the current price, and I will explain to you why I think so.

In their investor presentation they mention their Q3 2021 results with 1,588 Bitcoins mined which at the current price of $43k per Bitcoin is a whopping $68.2M. That's right, this is a SPAC with actual revenue. But that isn’t the only revenue-stream, Core Scientific also rents out hardware to 3rd party mining operations, it is like an Amazon AWS for crypto-currency mining. Their estimated revenue for the whole year of 2021 was $493M, that's half a billion USD.

Their projected revenue for 2022 is 1.14B USD. I know people are skeptical when it comes to revenue projections of SPACs, and that is the only sane thing to do. But given this projection is just a single year ahead, and that they already generated a substantial amount of revenue in the last year, I would like to make an exception here and believe them for a second. The best thing is, all of their projections are based on Bitcoin being at $30k, or 40% lower than it is now at $43k, which means in reality revenue and profit would be much higher if Bitcoin stays at the current price. If it goes back to $60k they would be 100% higher.

Their adjusted EBITDA for 2021 is $203M, and for 2022 they expect to make $572M. Just read the last sentence again, this company made over $200M profit last year, and is going to make $572M in this year. This is not some 2028 evtol revenue projection of a company that has a 3D rendering of an ugly looking helicopter, this is cold hard cash in a bank account.

Running a bitcoin mining operation and calculating your expected revenue for the future is basically dependent on a few variables. 1. Electricity cost, 2. Hardware, 3. Mining difficulty and of course the 4. Bitcoin price. The first 3. variables are pretty easy to project and I don’t think that there is much uncertainty in them. The mining difficulty for Bitcoin should have even developed positively, as many mining operations in China had to shut down.

So the revenue and profit projections of Core Scientific for 2022 really only depend on a single unknown variable, which is the price of Bitcoin. Which means to understand if XPDI is a good investment or not, we only need to understand where the Bitcoin price might be headed.

As most of you might be aware of, we are right in the middle of maybe the biggest asset inflation period in human history. The FED recently addressed this inflation by acknowledging that it is not transitory, and that only a change in fiscal and monetary policy can really get it down again. That is a huge shift from previous statements, and should be a good sign that we might be onto something here.

Many people speculate on how the markets will look like this year, but personally I am convinced that inflation is yet to peak. The economy as a whole is like a big container-ship, and it takes some time to change course or even slow down. So at least for all of 2022 there is a good argument to make that all asset classes, including crypto-currency will see more gains. Fundamentally nothing has changed and Covid is still running hot with new variants, there are a lot of important events this year for crypto such as Ethereum 2.0 launch of staking as well as layer 2 solutions to be deployed. Bitcoin will profit from these positive headwinds and continue to be an asset which gains popularity among institutional investors.

Core Scientific’s latest press release, which can be found here [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220105005454/en/Core-Scientific-Announces-December-Updates](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220105005454/en/Core-Scientific-Announces-December-Updates)

mentions “**Core Scientific minted 1,044 bitcoins in December..**” which means they made 1044\* $43k = $44.9M revenue in a single month just from mining not including rents from hosting customers.

2022-01-07 03:21:05,"My Criticism on Bitcoin I'd like to outline my thesis on Bitcoin for 2022 and beyond.  I have been involved in BTC for a long time and I have been very bullish on the network in the past.  However, I don't believe in falling in love with an asset.  I believe in constantly reviewing your thesis, since the industry and environment are highly dynamic.

So, here are my criticisms on BTC and why I think it will underperform in the short/mid term:

* Bitcoin Network lacks the maneuverability to implement changes &amp; new technology.  This is for several reasons.  
   * First, the network's strength is its longevity and security.  We are very careful for any modifications we make to the network as a whole, because we worry that any change could bring in a vulnerability.  For that reason, BTC network is very slow to implement updates and changes tend to be very minor.  
   * Second, BTC is decentralized and has no specific organization cemented as leaders.  Therefore, simple changes are often disputed and have even resulted in forking the community.  The creator of BTC is an anonymous person who hasn't appeared in a decade.  Therefore, there is no voice of leadership, which could provide concrete direction.
   * Third, Bitcoin was of course the first network ever launched.  Therefore, it is based on the most simple, albeit functional, technology.  It lacks smart contract support and requires a second layer for any type of feasible scaling.
* Lightning Network has been too slow to gain adoption.  Competing networks have already leapfrogged Bitcoin in terms of second layer solutions and real usage.
   * We cannot deny that Ethereum has made big strides on their implementation of Layer 2 technology.  There are multiple forms of layer 2's which are all competing and building out projects.  ZK-rollups, optimistic rollups, hybrid solutions.  I went to a talk on Lightning Network in 2015.  Today, it's still very under-utilized.
* Blockchain Payments are better solved with stablecoins.  
   * Like it or not, BTC and other floating value cryptocurrencies are volatile.  Volatility is the enemy of currency.  Currency is meant to be stable, the price of an item should not change within 10 minutes of making a purchase.  Commerce is still overwhelmingly done in USD and other fiat currencies.  Adding a secondary currency to the mix simply complicates transactions.  Further, BTC's high value creates awkward payment amounts which are difficult to understand at a quick glance.  For example, it's very confusing to convert 0.000025 BTC to USD.  It's much easier to convert something like 100,000 VND to USD, even though it has similarly high digits.  
   *  Stablecoins are quickly displacing BTC and other cryptocurrencies in payments.  This trend is not showing any sign of deceleration.
   * Please spare me the inflation argument.  Inflation in the USD was very low over the past decade.  It is obviously much higher today, but the Fed is reacting and controlling inflation is part of their mandate.  Further, 5% or even 10% inflation isn't enough to justify BTC price hitting $100K or beyond.  
* Confirmations are too slow for payments
   * Payments need to be verified near-instantaneously.  It is not acceptable to wait 10+ minutes for 1 confirmation.
* BTC's primary function is as a store of value.  Its value is derived from scarcity and demand.  When it was the only game in town, and when it was the only project anyone was using, that was enough.  However, today there are projects gaining major traction, all of which offer similar forms of scarcity.  Digital scarcity is constant in some form throughout the industry.  Therefore, it is not enough to warrant being the top project by itself.
* Other projects are showing up with real useful technology.  DeFi seems most relevant at the moment.  Blockchain gaming seems to be gaining traction as well.  NFT's are very hype-y but long term, their application outside the art world has great potential.  BTC has no way to really get involved with these new use cases.  It is pigeon holed into payments / single asset network.

So there you have it.  I'm sure you'll be tempted to tell me I'm an asshole, since you are probably a BTC investor.  But I'd really love to hear your critical responses to my concerns.  I would love to see Bitcoin succeed and continue to dominate the market.

Cryptocurrency meets the definition perfectly. The ""coins"" have no value in themselves, but people invest in them because they hope the value goes up. The only way the price can go up is that more people are tricked into investing in the cryptocurrency.

This is why people who claim that cryptocurrency is a ""good investment"" are so concerned with getting more people to invest. This is also the reason why they get angry at people who sell the currency.

Of course, it does not help that products like bitcoin seize huge amounts of energy and technological equipment that could have been used for something more useful (like gaming!).

2. Users of Chivo do not control their own private keys

3. The wallet is sort of like a walking passport/bank,  with a user phone number (which can be tied to their name through phone companies) being the login method. This reminds me of China's payment app that can be tied to their own CBDC and social credit score, restricting user's freedom.

2022-01-07 17:12:05,"Why am I so bullish on Bitcoin? It's easy to get fearfull about Bitcoin when your main interface with it is its price action. 

What has made a huge difference for me is to actually start experiment and building with Bitcoin and with Lightning in particular. Once you go down this rabbithole you'll actually learn what the Bitcoin network has to offer. I'll share with you some insights I have gotten so far and hopefully it inspires some of you to also start building

1. Lightning allows you to circumvent the banking system. Well duh.. But for hobbyist entrepreneurs like myself this is actually a big deal. Setting up a business bank-account is no easy task. Especially if you want to set up a small business to check market interest, being able to use a lightning address for payments is ideal and has allowed me to work on business ideas without the red tape of having to deal with institutions.
2. If you get yourself familiar witht he lightning CLI and you know a bit of Python you can already start doing interesting stuff that your average bank won't let you do. For instance automating refunds and payment forwarding. With just a few lines of code you can a payment processing business and make money on routing fees (given that payments need to be made in Bitcoin of course).
3. Last but not least I believe that an underexposed feature of the Bitcoin network are its nodes. I see nodes becoming much more than just for running the Bitcoin and Lightning software. They're basically a personal always-online server that offers a scalable solution for hosting decentralized applications. Where Ethereum for instance hosts its smart contracts on their basechain (which is hugely inefficient as every node needs to host a copy), bitcoin nodes allow for decentralized hosting of smart contracts and other applications on the nodes hardware. The difference being that only a relevant subset of the network has to run the smartcontract and that Bitcoin nodes can easily run by everyone. Use cases being things like self hosting your webshop, blogs, social media profile, videos, images and applications so you don't have to rely on software giants like Amazon, Youtube and Facebook anymore.

This is of course all far from reality, but I think this is where Bitcoin will have a huge advantage over many other blockchains and frankly where many other blockchains have made a huge mistake in choosing for a bloated basechain and a more centralized node system.",0.8993924260139465,0.1695275009228498,0.5249907715023993,0.131,0.013,0.856,0.9936

2022-01-07 17:51:03,"My brother sold all of his Bitcoin. Here's why I'm happy he did it A bit of background:
A couple months ago, I posted in here about my brother considering selling his bitcoin, as he was almost out of cash and temporarily out of work. There were some great suggestions in the comments of that post, which were very much appreciated, such as offering to loan him cash and I'd hold onto his bitcoin until he can pay me back, or for him to sell his initial stake and hold onto profit.

He didn't want to take a loan from me, as he didn't want to be in my debt, which I understand. He started by selling his initial stake, leaving the profit in bitcoin. And yesterday he sold the rest of it, as he needed the cash. He does have a job now, but he needed the cash in the next few days. 

While it's disappointing that he sold all his bitcoin, I am happy he did it, because he completely sees bitcoin's use as a store of value/form of saving now. His original intention in buying bitcoin was to make a quick profit, like a lot of people who got into the market in 2021. He said to me when he was selling it that he ""would have spent all that money on shite"" if he hadn't bought the bitcoin, so he's glad he had held it in bitcoin, because he would have had nothing now if he hadn't bought bitcoin in the first place. He also said he will be buying more once he can afford to. Having made a profit on it, he has a positive outlook on it, as opposed to people who have sold at a loss, or haven't gotten the moon gains they thought they'd get. 

He had also bought shitcoins around the time he bought bitcoin, all of which are in a loss position. He is completely disillusioned by shitcoins now and is just waiting for them to breakeven/go slightly in the green to sell them off too. So when he does have the money to get back into investing, it will be in bitcoin and not shitcoins.

(Full disclosure, I'm not a bitcoin maxi, I also own shitcoins, but fully aware they are relatively short term punts to make profit on to then convert to bitcoin. If I lose all the money I have in them, so be it).",-0.9258858561515808,0.18218294051627384,0.4164983164983166,0.102,0.051,0.847,0.9779

Bitcoin just doesn’t care about fiat pricing.

If that phrase isn’t something that makes sense, maybe just trade because you need no Bitcoin at all and you have a chance, albeit slight imho, to make decent money. It is, however, very difficult to beat HODLing if the general Bitcoin thesis plays out.

For the FUD believing crowd, line up large, long term, naked shorts (or hush til you sign up and HODL a short).

I personally believe that the thesis plays out not because of anything other than the next generations to run our governments have seen enough of fiat messes (the new, forming one inclusive and it’s just getting started) and completely understand that Bitcoin doesn’t care.

Once that phrase sinks in, you will HODL as much as you can reasonably afford and likely ignore all the swings (up or down).

It states that the global wealth is 418 342 billion dollar ( in 2021, page 7, table 1 in the Global wealth report 2021 PDF )so $418 342 000 000 000.

There are 21 000 000 bitcoin out there ( I know that there are lost coins already) .

So 418 342 billion dollar / 21 million bitcoins means that around 19 million dollar bitcoin price the sum of bitcoin price equals the global household wealth on the Earth. In this case the bitcoin owners stating that they own everything on the planet Earth. Even a 10 million dollar bitcoin price means that bitcoin holders owns half the Earth.

&amp;#x200B;

SENDING 

\-SPOTLIGHT function, if you put in an ADDRESS, you can shine spotlight to make sure that it is the right address you put in.  You get a string back acknowledging you are spotlighting the right recipient.     Sending BTC is so stressful especially when dealing with large amounts.  It always makes me crap my pants when I consider that I can loose my entire savings in a simple address mistake.

INACTIVITY

\-After 3 years of inactivity, a field where by you can put in an email and recover your BTC.   You get a warning every year that in 24 months, 12 months, that there has been no activity and the recovery clause will be thrown if this persist longer than 3 years.

Every single one of us could be in a car crash tomorrow, or a natural disaster or a fire where our BTC access gets wiped out.   Even hit by a bus, and our families are out of luck.  This would be a NEXT of KIN function that could be turned on or off by the user if they wish.  

CUSTODY

\-key aliases, that you can create and delete at your will.  This will help with business custody.   You can create lets say 3 aliases that are not the real key, but function as the key for as long as you allow it.   Hence in order to do a send 3 separate people need to approve the send with their alias-key .Hence custody can be maintained by organizations with 3 managers having to sign off on the transaction.   If one of them is let go or fired, you delete the entry and nothing lost, you add a new replacement and viola.  Chain of custody maintained no one needs to know main key other than the owner.  Also if the owner makes alias for him/herself that means they need to sing off/approve the transaction with the input of their alias-key

This will make it way more business/institution friendly. 

This is where I think BTC is the weakest from an institution and business point of view.  One bad actor can pull off the heist of a century with a button click.  A country like El Salvador can be robbed in one move, hopefully they have many wallets, but from my understanding none of these people have self custody including Michael Saylor, they trust 3rd parties to do their custody and that is incredibly weak and prone to bad apples spoiling the party. 

Institutional self custody needs this bad!

2022-01-08 06:09:57,"No, Bitcoin doesn't need the energy consumption of Argentina I feel like all those commenting on the high energy consumption of the bitcoin network, are missing the point. Bitcoin doesn't require the energy consumption of Argentina to function. In fact it would function just as well with just a couple raspberry Pi's mining it for the whole world , if they were the only miners (albeit it would be more vulnerable to some forms of attacks). Bitcoin protocol has a variable called difficulty which is automatically adjusted every couple of weeks depending on how frequently new blocks were added to the blockchain during the last weeks (or equally, how fast new BTC got mined). If it was too often, difficulty will go up. If it wasn't often enough (~10 minutes / block on avg), difficulty will go down (it has actually happened plenty of times e.g. the weeks after China banning mining). Higher difficulty makes winning the bitcoin lottery miners constantly play, well... more difficult (the result of the hash value needs to be more consecutive zeroes).

All this to say.. It's not bitcoin burning all this energy and it isn't inherently wasteful. It's only human greed that's at play here. It's more miners trying to outperform, or outhash, the competing miners which keeps driving difficulty up and ups the ante for all miners.

If only two miners existed with equal Hash/s performance, they'd have each 50% of the BTC reward over time from the protocol. But if one of those wants a bigger share and runs 2x miner hardware, then the rewards would drop to 25% for the other guy, i.e. he'll be making half than before. So if that guy decides to also 2x his miner hardware, then they'll both be mining just as much BTC/h as initially, only using 2x the electricity.

@$500,000 BTC &lt;- $40b/year



Now, you can't use mining difficulty or future mining rewards to predict the price - anything could happen.
But the bitcoin halving cycle seems to accommodate very healthy price raises,

 i.e. we can assume the bitcoin market can sustain the current mining rewards of 12b/year at [6.25btc per block at 40k] 

Next cycle, if the market can handle a similar inflow we can easily achieve an average yearly price of $75,000, if we could handle double - $150,000. 

The following cycle, $150,000 would be 12b/yr inflow, $300k at 24b, ,$600k at $48b 


This is assuming miners act exactly the same as they did this year, and I didn't explain it the best but I hope that made some sense? 

I would like to make some real data on this, and also compare the potential mining reward inflows to market cap.



Quick note on mining. BTC mining will reward those with the cheaper energy, if you can harness stranded energy, implement cheap renewables, whatever is better than the traditional fossil fuels - you'll have an edge in mining.

Similarly, create faster mining hardware, and you have an edge.

A hallmark of an advanced civilization is high energy usage. Bitcoin is hardwired to push humanities energy efficiency and production, and our computer tech. Absolutely insane.",-0.9982380867004395,0.12602564102564104,0.4412820512820513,0.195,0.022,0.782,0.9974

Don't panic, just zoom out. The Bitcoin Fear &amp; Greed Index is at 10 today. The lowest level since March 2020. At that time, the COVID-19 pandemic had just started to spread around the world, and we had a liquidity crisis in all liquid markets.

This caused the price of Bitcoin to drop by more than 50% in a few hours to a low of $3.2K on some trading platforms.

The fear was extreme. However, a strong rebound was quickly observed thanks to the HODLers of last resort who had seen a unique opportunity to seize. What happened next proved them right.

Today, the price of Bitcoin is at $42K. This is almost 40% lower than the ATH of November 10, 2021, at $69K. But is it time to give in to extreme fear? I don't think so. Above all, we must keep control of our emotions and take a step back. Don't panic and take a step back. It's as simple as that.

If you doubt it, ask yourself this question: would you have been in extreme fear if someone had told you two years ago that the price of Bitcoin would have been $42K in January 2022? I don't think so!

So, I got into Bitcoin and other crypto around 5 months, a little late to the party, and seen a few dips since then, but I'm happily DCA'ing, building up a portfolio with at least 35% BTC, but planning to go higher. 

My question is how did COVID affect Bitcoin's pump over the last 2 years. At the beginning of the pandemic, Bitcoin was at around $9000, and apart from the peak at end of 2017, it was never really about that value. 

Obviously, since then, it's been heavily trending up. Alot of people had it really tough during COVID-19, but a fair number of people, myself included, managed to save a tonne of money. Working from home, not travelling, quarantined etc helped me pay off debt and set myself up to start investing for my future.

It's probably correlation, not causation, but is there any risk that the last 2 years, COVID has actually helped Bitcoin and that what we've seen is a result of it?

For the current cycle there's a top around the peak volume and then strangely enough a second top formed (and the actual ATH) with extremely low relative volume. Perhaps the second top might even be the result of some sort of manipulation to try and create more hype?

2022-01-08 23:47:02,"Argue against this, you’re against Bitcoin At its most basic function, Bitcoin is ""a peer to peer electronic **cash** system"" [as outlined in the whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)

                                  ..yet measures put in place by regulators over the years have almost completely blockaded and tried to cover up this fact with:

*Identification requirements to buy/sell (which essentially compile huge databases of who owns Bitcoin, and how much)
*Enforced Tax Reporting (to collect data and steal profits)
*Illegality of peer to peer exchange (one needs a banking license for permission to exchange Bitcoin for fiat)

all of which are antithetical to Bitcoin existing as it needs to do direly.

These hostile policies masquerade as necessary safety measures, yet are merely attempts to stop the inevitable evolution many are going to experience when the incentive to use decentralized money over fiat backed by the threat of force is a clear decision to everyone. 

These barriers of entry do not need to exist for Bitcoin to thrive.  Instead, they are holding back the free flow of money.  Bitcoin could easily be accepted everywhere, but neither retailers nor consumers want the headache of having to record and report every little transaction.  What’s the real incentive of using BTC for transactions over the traditional system when that same system has made it no easier to transact with on purpose?

Plus, the big one: taxation is legal extortion.  Why should the state get to skim off profit that was essentially created because of their poor monetary policies?  Oh yeah, because Bitcoin being money itself, bypassing the whole fiat slavery system altogether is going to eventually wake everyone up and make it impossible for any government to fund itself in the near future.

Especially in a ""great reset"" world that has diminished if not decimated the quality of life for billions worldwide, and simultaneously enriched those who aim to control the masses without shame, now is the time to change.  Doesn't money printer go brrr until inevitable hyperinflation and global collapse at this point anyway?

Bitcoin is and has been doing work for many years now, and those who understand it know it is fertile ground for taking back liberty.  It's more ready than ever for full embrace for anyone who understands the real dilemma every individual is faced with- a life of bondage in one way or another, set up for you at birth.  

It’s a bigger part of the reason we’re witnessing the ramping up of government tyranny worldwide than we’ve been led on.  Surely I am not the only one who intuits this.

For those who didn't use Bitcoin before the days of regulation, there were many who did and directly experienced that the true potential in this technology came from the how Bitcoin allowed the creation of a new, grassroots economy.   It is a novel free market money, the likes of which will continue to shift the power dynamics of the world greatly the more it’s adopted.

Many enthusiasts and shills alike over the years have argued that regulation of Bitcoin and the crypto markets in general was/is necessary to establish more legitimacy within the mainstream, and although that’s bullshit, now that mass adoption has arrived, all regulations concerning exchange of Bitcoin should be nullified.  

Bitcoin's code speaks for itself.  It doesn't get any more legit than this, otherwise it would have never gained the traction it did to become a continual success. 

Especially with countries like El Salvador recognizing it as legal tender with more to surely come, and the many other places that having placed minimal restrictions on it mainly because they don’t view it as an existential threat to their empire, surely the “Land of the Free, Home of the Brave” in recognizing people’s right to pursue happiness (if it did) would be a bastion for Bitcoin worldwide.

In sum, where Bitcoin's true potential lies in using it as electronic cash outside of the legacy system's rules that clearly aim to slow if not completely curve this unstoppable project. Instead, what needs to stop is waiting for changes in policy that will allow us to do what we already can, and just do it.",-0.982526421546936,0.19226265632515632,0.536670274170274,0.142,0.068,0.79,0.9956

2022-01-09 03:53:38,"Why measuring electric consumption of Bitcoin transaction(s) is non-sense As you could've read already, there are lot's of articles and posts on different forums about the tremendous energy consumption of Bitcoin transaction(s). In those articles the writers tend to compare Bitcoin network with other payment processors such as VISA. In this post, I'll try to explain, why I think, that it's non-sense to compare these two with each other.

**a. VISA != Bitcoin**  
Bitcoin is a vault, a coin, a banknote, a bank, a bank assistant, a bank director, a central bank, a minting facility, a storage of transactions, a payment processor, an accountant.  
VISA on the other hand is only a *payment processor*.   
From what I've mentioned here a smart individual will realize, that Bitcoin is a whole financial system, while VISA is only one part of the FIAT financial system that states operate.   
To compare Bitcoin with VISA would be like to compare CPU with the whole smartphone.

**b. More transactions don't require more hashrate**  
In for ex. grocery store, as you have more customers buying groceries, you'll need more cashiers to take care of greater customer base.  
With VISA (payment processor), as they are the authority to process and validate the transactions, greater the amount of transactions to validate, the more units of computers in datacenters it will require. So there is a (almost) direct relationship between the number of transactions to process and the electricity consumption it ""burns"".  
This however, isn't the case for Bitcoin. As you presumably know, the Bitcoin code is programmed in such way, that new bitcoin blocks are mined *on average* every 10 minutes. What this does is that even with a greater hashrate (computing power), the mining difficulty changes accordingly (this is calculated every 2016 blocks), resulting in difficulty going up (being harder to do). On the other hand, if hashrate decreases (less of computing power), the difficulty adjusts downwards (being easier to do). This happens, so that new blocks cannot be sped up or slowed down with changes in network hashrate. This means that there isn't a direct relationship between amount of transactions and electricity consumption from computing power - hashrate.   
Hashrate here functions as a ""firewall"" or a ""protection"" from a malicious actor, who would want to take advantage of the network, gathering the majority of computing power (hashrate) to edit the recognized truth - transaction history. The higher the hashrate, the harder it is for any entity to gather something like 51% of hashrate. Today, it is close to impossible. One could say, that everything above ""necessary"" hashrate is wasted, because it isn't used to confirm more transactions. But he, who would think such thing, would be wrong. Because like there isn't such thing as ""correct price"" or the ""right amount of lamborghinis"" to be produced in one year, neither is there a right amount of hashrate. Of course it wouldn't be good to have very little hashrate as this would make the network more vulnerable to malicious actors, but hashrate is a dynamically adjusted accordingly to market forces implemented in Bitcoin code.   
Today, people can transfer even small amounts of bitcoin ""on-chain"", which would make them enormously expensive in terms of computing power, but this isn't presumably going to be a thing in the future. To send a transaction on-chain would be like shooting a pigeon  with a ballistic missile. Bitcoin is something that was thought about for a long time, energy money. Which cannot be created out of thin air, but to get a reward (new coins) and transaction fees, one (more like a mining pool) has to spend a great amount of electricity in order to make a proof of his work. So he cannot cheat, he cannot present the work without doing the work. In the future, Bitcoin blockchain will become a ""settlement layer"", where in one transaction tens or even hundreads lightning channels or sidechain results of transactions can be settled. 

Bitcoin blockchain is very expensive way to store data, as it is distributed all around the globe. But it isn't for buying a coffee. Think of it in terms of banks, people do things in their accounts from commercial banks and commercial banks then settle disputes with central bank. Central bank doesn't validate every citizen's purchase from e-shop. As many people see it, including me, you will use lightning for your payments or sidechain solutions and on-chain transactions will be for major transactions between institutions, ?states? , companies and not 1 person to 1 person transactions anymore, but rather coinjoin-like transactions, where let's say 100 people are in inputs and 200 outputs (the receiver + change address).

2022-01-09 18:21:11,"Do crypto exchanges have the potential to kill bitcoin? Hello folks

I have been all morning thinking about a rather disturbing realization. As much as the central banks have the ability to literally print money by selling bonds or issuing stimulus checks, commercial banks are really the ones actually responsible for drastically increasing the monetary supply through lending. Obviously the control of central banks over interest rates may incentive higher levels of lending by lowering interest rates, but the critical factor here to me seems to be the reserve ratio banks must hold on to: in any case where this ratio is below 1 (hint: always), banks have the actual power to create money themselves. Example: if I lend you $20, you may spend them. Or I may keep them and spend them myself. But it is impossible for the both of us to spend those $20, it's either you or me. On the contrary, if I make a $20 deposit in a bank, they bank may lend them to you (or a fraction of them if the reserve ratio is not exactly 0), but I may still spend those same $20 !

What sparks my interest is that this is a practice that has been sustained for a long, long time whereas stimulus checks and bond transactions seem more limited in amount and duration. So in comparison, the creation of money by banks seems to be a way larger inflationary threat than the policy of central banks itself.

As I understand, Bitcoin, and cryptocurrency in general, aim to get rid of the legacy monetary and financial systems by offering a monetary system where the available supply is fixed and immutable. Everything seems legit up to this point. However, exchanges like Coinbase or Binance offer lending products in cryptocurrency, so they are actually acquiring the lending functions of traditional banks.

And the key question here would be: is there anything preventing the crypto exchanges from using a reserve ratio different than 1 (obviously not regulation lol)? In other words, can they lend bitcoin that does not exist?

I suspect their ability to lend funds they don't actually posses may be limited by some feature of the blockchain technology and the ""not your keys, not your crypto"" thing, but at this point I just fail to see the connection.

TL;DR: can crypto exchanges print money the same way traditional banks do by lending cryptocurrencies? is my logic somehow flawed?",-0.9998759031295776,0.0010651629072681724,0.4147556390977443,0.06,0.075,0.865,-0.8627

There are many tutorials on YouTube on the setup process, so ill just give my  overall impressions.

I'm running an Linux machine so my first step was to download the Ledger Live software, install it, and generate my 24 word passphrase which was probably the longest step of the entire process. 

Once this was done, I installed the Bitcoin application on the Ledger using the Ledger Live software, and sent over a small amount of BTC to ensure that everything was working and I didn't mess anything up.

I then decided to try and recover my device using my passphrase, just to see if things could be recovered correctly in case the worst should happen. After reconfirming my passphrase and reinstalling the Bitcoin application, my previous deposit was showing up as expected.

Now it was just a case of sending over the rest of my Stats from Kraken and waiting for the transactions to be approved on the blockchain.

I decided I want to use bitcoin as much as I can in my daily life.

2022-01-10 08:44:52,"Bitcoin Snaps 6-Day Losing Streak, Holds Above $40K Bitcoin’s price rose on Sunday, after snapping a six-day losing streak and avoiding a drop below the key psychological level of $40,000 that some cryptocurrency analysts had warned might trigger a steeper sell-off.

As of press time bitcoin (BTC) was changing hands around $42,100, up 2% over the past 24 hours, based on CoinDesk pricing. The cryptocurrency had been on the verge of a seven-day losing streak that would have been its longest since 2018, but the price turned around on Saturday, eking out a small gain, and has stayed on an upward trajectory since.

The price hadn’t fallen below $40,000 since September 2021, and is well off the all-time high near $69,000 reached in November, so there had been speculation that a drop below $40,000 might spur a deeper retrenchment.

“If the market has based at these levels, we might get that short squeeze we’ve been waiting so patiently for,” the Singapore-based crypto trading firm QCP Capital wrote Sunday on its Telegram channel.

January tends to be a seasonally weak month for bitcoin, but this year has been especially harsh, with the largest cryptocurrency still down 9% so far in 2022.",-0.9995900988578796,-0.047896825396825396,0.5252777777777778,0.04,0.11,0.85,-0.9079

They’re going to see those as attractive levels to buy,” he said.

Mike Novogratz on Future Outlook of Crypto Market

The CEO of Galaxy Digital, Mike Novogratz, talked about the outlook for the cryptocurrency market in an interview with CNBC last week. He was asked about the falling prices of cryptocurrencies, particularly bitcoin.

“Part of the bitcoin story was the debasement of fiat currency and as the Fed looks to get more hawkish, some of that comes off,” he explained.

“Crypto had a monster year last year. It’s hard to think you’re going to grow to the sky nonstop. This is a pullback,” he stressed, adding:

We see a tremendous amount of institutional demand on the sidelines. I’m not nervous in the medium-term.

Nonetheless, Novogratz cautioned, “We are going to have a lot of volatility in the next few weeks.”

Novogratz was also asked if he thought there was a floor at $38,000 for bitcoin after he said, “you will find a lot of support for bitcoin” around $38K to $42K. The Galaxy Digital executive replied:

I know big institutions who are going through their process to put positions on. They’re going to see those as attractive levels to buy.

“On the charts, $38,000, $40,000 feel like where we should bottom,” he emphasized. On Friday, Novogratz tweeted, “We entered the buy zone…”",-0.9994795918464661,0.14362745098039215,0.3490196078431373,0.046,0.031,0.922,0.7287

2022-01-10 19:51:10,"Where Can I Learn the Calculus in Regards to Investing in Bitcoin? Hi,  


I recently purchased my first bitcoin and in this crazy world it really filled me with a sense of optimism.  I believe in decentralized money and I think bitcoin is a 21st solution to old problems like fiat currency and central banking which, I believe is at the root, of most of society's ills..  I am familiar with individuals like Rothbard, Von Mises, etc., and intend to hodl bitcoin as a part of a financial plan to weather inflation and to preserve my humble about of wealth I have saved.  I think 2022 and the following years are going to see the fiat we are accustomed to to being completely debauched and the governments will propose a centralized crypto currency  as a substitution/solution.  I'm not interested in their crypto or fiat really, I'm just looking to make sure I don't get ruined financially by the inflation I think we can all agree is coming.  


My question is where can I start learning how to understand the calculus of investing in regards to bitcoin?  I am a mathematics student and enjoy math, I just not sure what numbers I need to be looking at to inform my investments in regards to bitcoin.  I am not interested in day trading crypto or looking for a get rich quick scheme.  I plan on hodling.  I simply want to optimize when I invest in the dips to maximize my investments.  I purchased bitcoin at $50k and it has since dipped.  I don't mind the dip.  I'm in this game for the long term.  I'm just not sure if I should buy more now or wait a little bit longer to see if the value will go down even more and I do not like investing blinding.  I want to be as informed as I can be when I make any decision - especially when it comes to my money.  


If anyone has any resources they can share, I'd appreciate it.  I'm not afraid of math or studying.  Lay it on me.

2022-01-10 23:01:56,"Countries around the world outlawing Bitcoin Mining is a ray of hope I must admit the CO2 issue is the one aspect that bothers me about Bitcoin from time to time. Especially if, as others have pointed out, big firms can not easily invest in Bitcoin now for fear of tainting their green image. For example I don't think Tesla could now easily invest another chunk of money in Bitcoin, since they have announced it has an issue with CO2.

That's why this [news of countries banning mining](https://fortune.com/2022/01/05/crypto-blackouts-bitcoin-mining-bans-kosovo-iran-kazakhstan-iceland/) (paywalled, I only read the introduction) actually gives me hope. What if by that way, all mining operations using ""dirty"" energy get shut down and only ""green"" energy mining remains? Then it seems to me the one argument against Bitcoin would be eliminated, and for example companies like Tesla could accept Bitcoin again without getting flak.

Or maybe I am just looking for Hopium...?",-0.9998877048492432,-0.08535353535353535,0.5959595959595959,0.115,0.073,0.812,0.7371

Even though we're currently 38% lower than November, $40.5K is also a whopping 40% higher than the flash crash to $29K last May. That new, higher floor will not be missed by institutional investors. Even if we see another dip tomorrow, next week or next month, given the pace of adoption, accceptance and real life utility that crypto has been seeing these past months, that new low is far higher than many expected and is reason to be bullish going forward. The key metric for acceptance of any asset class as a store of value is twofold: scarcity and desirability. 

ALL securities have varying degrees of risk, but crypto has traditionally been seen as exhibiting far greater exposure to risk than Equities, Bonds, Commodities, Property or Cash. At the point when the new 'low' for BTC is a balmy 50K+, the psychological aspect of NOT owning BTC is going to see major institutional adoption. Particularly if (imho when) another country adopts BTC as legal tender and/or a 'pure' BTC EFT is finally approved by the SEC.

2022-01-12 01:21:00,"This year has fallen by 14%, Bitcoin has the worst start to the year in history After falling below $40,000 for the first time since September last year, bitcoin has fallen 14% this year, marking its worst start to a year on record.

During Monday’s session, bitcoin fell as much as 6%, briefly dipping below the $40,000 mark. For the year, bitcoin has fallen 14% for the year, its worst start to a year since 2012.

“It’s a shocking start to 2022,” said Fiona Cincotta, senior financial markets analyst at City Index. “There’s a lot going on, even though we know bitcoin is unstable.”

The COVID-19 pandemic has brought Bitcoin further into the mainstream asset industry, and many institutional investors have already begun to participate in the cryptocurrency market over the past 2021. However, the recent ""singing of eagles"" by the Federal Reserve has suppressed many risk assets, and Bitcoin is also among them.

“Cryptocurrencies are likely to remain under pressure as the Fed tightens liquidity,” said Jay Hatfield, CEO of Infrastructure Capital Advisors. “Bitcoin could drop below $20,000 by the end of 2022.”

Noelle Acheson, head of market analysis at Genesis Global Trading, pointed out that the Bitcoin slump appears to be driven more by short-term traders than by long-term holders. Long-term investors are ""buying the dip,"" her research shows.

Previously, many analysts believed that Bitcoin had a good chance of rising to $100,000 in the new year. But according to a survey of its clients conducted by JPMorgan, only 5% of clients believe bitcoin will reach $100,000 by the end of 2022, and most believe it will exceed $60,000.",-0.9999920129776001,-0.031601731601731596,0.5375180375180376,0.027,0.073,0.9,-0.8765

Bitcoin went up as high as $43,106 on Tuesday, leading a broad market recovery in crypto. The move came after the stock market in the U.S. [halted its five-day rout](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-10/asia-stocks-may-benefit-from-late-u-s-rebound-markets-wrap?sref=3REHEaVI) ahead of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) data release on Wednesday.

At the time of publication, the most valued cryptocurrency was changing hands above $42,800, up over 2% in the past 24 hours, according to [CoinDesk data](https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/).  


 

Bloomberg [reported](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-10/asia-stocks-may-benefit-from-late-u-s-rebound-markets-wrap?sref=3REHEaVI) the stock market climbed on Tuesday after Jerome Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve, reassured investors the Fed will combat the current high inflation, signaling the central bank may reduce its balance sheet this year.

As CoinDesk reported, bitcoin and the broad crypto market have [behaved strongly](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/01/10/first-mover-asia-bitcoin-below-40k-before-regaining-ground-altcoins-fall/) like a risk asset recently.

 

A key event to watch on Wednesday is the release of December’s U.S. consumer price index (CPI). Economists [anticipate](https://www.ft.com/content/59c73cd5-5332-455e-8a47-9fd0b77fc4d2) a 0.5% month-to-month increase in CPI to 7.1%.

In the past two months, bitcoin’s price experienced [high volatility](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/12/10/us-inflation-rate-surges-to-68-in-november-a-4-decade-high-bitcoin-jumps/) after the CPI data release. While some crypto traders and investors view bitcoin as a hedge against inflation, others consider it as a risk asset like stocks, which react to tightened monetary policy resulting from high inflation.

Most other major cryptocurrencies also rose on Tuesday. Ether, the second-biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up over 5% to above $3,200, at the time of publication. Layer 1 token NEAR remained the biggest winner. It is up nearly 13% over the past week despite the crypto sell-off.  


 

Bitcoin ([BTC](https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin/)) went trading above the $40,000 support level and was up about 3% over the past 24 hours from 9 p.m. UTC. Buyers are starting to return to the market, although the upside appeared to be limited to the $45,000 resistance level, which is also near the 200-day moving average.

On intraday charts, upside momentum is improving, which suggests buyers could remain active into the Asia trading day.

BTC is the most oversold since Dec. 10, according to the relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart. Typically, oversold readings precede price recoveries, similar to what occurred in late September. This time, however, price reaction to the RSI and other indicators have been delayed.

Still, on the weekly chart, the RSI is not yet oversold, which decreases the chance of significant buying pressure.",-0.9997169375419617,0.059771062271062284,0.3975091575091575,0.09,0.034,0.876,0.9749

In a world where speed, transparency, and security are almost fundamental, crypto investment becomes a necessity rather than an option. At its heart, cryptocurrency is the perfect medium of exchange for this exponentially emerging hybrid world. The cryptocurrency market has experienced enormous growth over the past decade, and it is set to expand to new heights in 2022. While investing in cryptocurrency may offer growth potential, cryptocurrencies as a whole have proven to be a volatile asset class. However, institutional investors have begun participating in the crypto market—supporting trading and building financial infrastructure. These trends point to a greater mainstreaming of the asset class and its increasing appeal to a wider range of investors Hitesh Malviya. Take a look.

Chief among them is that they see cryptocurrencies as a smart investment, believing that they may get paid this way in the future, as well as greater financial flexibility.

The survey is based on a questionnaire of 2,000 cryptocurrency owners in the US and UK, so people in other countries may have different opinions. In countries with capital controls or high inflation, the number could be higher, but those places weren't surveyed, so it's impossible to know what their opinion is.

&amp;#x200B;

An interesting finding from the study is the main motivation for people to hold cryptocurrencies. Some people may think that most people are just there to make money, but according to Paysafe, the biggest motivation is because of the belief that cryptocurrencies will become the dominant form of international currency in the next few years.

2022-01-12 21:19:28,"The ""Death Cross"" is approaching again, can Bitcoin continue to make a comeback against the wind? After Bitcoin's worst year start,

Holders of the largest cryptocurrency are now facing an ominous indicator of technical price patterns that suggest bitcoin's future may be murky.

Known as a ""death cross,"" the indicator occurs when an asset's average trading price over the past 50 days falls below its 200-day moving average, indicating that the asset's momentum is declining. Mati Greenspan, founder of Quantum Economics, said that while that hasn’t happened to Bitcoin yet, it looks like it will happen later this week, “with a very clear chart.”

So far in 2022, Bitcoin has only been up for three sessions. Although the second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum, rose to around $3,233 per coin on Tuesday, it also appears to be forming a ""death cross.""

Juthica Chou, head of OTC trading at cryptocurrency trading platform Kraken OTC, said of the “death cross”:

“It’s not surprising that Bitcoin has had a really mixed performance over this period, given some of the macro backdrop that is affecting price action. Still, we’ve seen a very healthy rally over the past 24 hours and I think the fundamentals are still very strong. ""

The cryptocurrency has been under pressure in recent weeks, with bitcoin down more than 30 percent since reaching a high of nearly $69,000 in November. Crypto-assets are experiencing a fresh round of losses as the likelihood of a rate hike by the Federal Reserve in March becomes more and more likely. What you need to know is that in addition to raising interest rates, the Fed has already communicated to the market that it may shrink its balance sheet ahead of schedule.

Speculative investments like Bitcoin are being abandoned under such aggressive tightening. It is reported that only 5% of the clients surveyed by JPMorgan Chase expect Bitcoin to reach $100,000 per piece by the end of 2022.

Although the ""death cross"" is a bearish indicator, Bitcoin's historical record surrounding the indicator remains unclear. When the metric appeared last June, Bitcoin’s performance was dismal, but when the metric appeared last March, Bitcoin’s performance was strong. The emergence of this indicator in November 2019 sent Bitcoin lower.

Mati Greenspan said:

“Some say this (death cross) is bearish, but almost every previous 'death cross' or 'golden cross' has proven to be a good buying opportunity for Bitcoin. For all of them in 2021 Any other indicator is a good buying opportunity for someone who has been in the bitcoin market before.”

Craig W. Johnson, Chief Marketing Technician at Piper Sandler, said:

“Whenever there is a 'death cross' for a broad-cap index or a stock, most (though not all) of the bad news has already been priced in. I think the time may be bigger for bitcoin than the current price at this point in time risk.""

Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) issued its latest warning that the parallels between cryptocurrency price movements and the stock market could pose risks to financial markets. According to the IMF, the correlation between the U.S. stock index and Bitcoin rose from 0.01 in 2017 to 2019 to 0.36 in 2020.

Analysts have long noticed that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies tend to move in tandem with the stock market, and that link has strengthened recently. Both stocks and cryptocurrencies reversed early losses to trade higher in the afternoon on Tuesday. Both have seen volatility recently amid signs the Fed is willing to tighten policy faster than previously expected.

Currently, Bitcoin’s 100-day correlation with the S&amp;P 500 is 0.44, the highest level since the fourth quarter of 2020 and one of the highest levels a decade ago. (A coefficient of 1 means the assets move in the same way, and -1 means the assets move in the opposite direction.)",-0.9999520778656006,0.07006535947712421,0.37618464052287576,0.063,0.089,0.848,-0.9641

Because:

1. For the first time in human history we have a technology which makes an individual truly sovereign. It is as game changing as a printing press + gunpowder. 

2. It gives back and preserves your time.

3. It peacefully demonetizes the state. Puts a wrench in to money printing scam from witch most of the state's funding is produced.

4. It helps to bring humanity in to a technologically driven deflationary system where cooperation is the key to future prosperity.

Bitcoin will not solve all the problems, but at least it is moving us in a right direction, away from totalitarian fascist dictatorship, and gives hope for a better future.

At that time, in 2017, we had very big moves every day. It was so scary to watch how fast a minutecandle rose or burnt down in seconds.

That was a real rollercoaster and nothing compared to today. 
We have more and more adoption and that is the real good thing. 2017 some real big whales could drive the price up and down alone in minutes.

And here comes the difference to Michael Saylor and why it’s good there are people like him: He sure has a big take in BTC and some are scared about that but he really gives me a feeling that he will not sell or speculate with it.
He accumulate and hodl. That gives
all others some kind of stability and I trust him and think more will follow this startegie. 

This is the way Bitcoin gets more and more adopted. We are over 40k and in fear. 2017 we never thought about that level. 16k was scary.
We need people with that kind of balls who buy the coins from the dipping whales and big players with strong hands.  Small countries will follow El Salvador and go into Bitcoin in the hope to get more wealth for the people and I’m sure that this is their chance to make this happen.
Big countries can’t stay out at some time any longer. 

It’s a win for all - it’s the new G(old) or even much bigger- get some btc / satoshi (small part of btc like cents for dollar) and hold it. Every little counts and we all will have a take in the number one asset of the future.

I hope I’m asking this question in the right subreddit.

Due to governmental and financial instability concerns we (here in the Netherlands) have created a group called society 4.0 

With a bitcoin maximalist subgroup we are trying to convince this parallel society to embrace bitcoin as their primary means of exchange. 

(Silver coins as offline alternative)

We are however running into many bad, and some good arguments against this. 
One argument I cannot debunk is the miner majority problem. 

If opponents of bitcoin (say the banking elites) manage to acquire 51% of the hashrate. Would that jeopardise the safety of bitcoin immediately? Or would nodes have some way of excluding the hostile miners from the network? Or is there another solution?

Not saying this is a likely scenario. Just want to be able to put everyones concerns to rest.

2022-01-13 22:04:30,"About Bitcoin volatility and holding from an investor to new investors I've been investing in markets for 10 years now. I've dealt with stocks, stocks options, private and public bonds, real state funds, criptos, peer-to-peer lending. I'm brazilian, so I've invested through the 2014 crisis. Bitcoin is yet a volatile active. I sincere have yet doubts on Bitcoin sucess in the long run. I mean, faith aside, bitcoin potencial and advantages against tradicional money are a fact. But its success depends on public aceptance, not became necessarily the only coin in the world, but a good aceptance over some markets. I do believe that bitcoin has a good probability to get that aceptance, it is already happening, but there is yet some residual probability that things go wrong.

But my point with this post is to give an advice to less experienced investors: bitcoin is a market valued active and as so it is very normal dips on its price. I've passed dips in price in many investments and, if you did a good value analisys, then the market flutuations in the short term don't matter.

If you believe, based on some evidence that are already out there, that bitcoin will succeed, then don't worry about dip, and most importantly: if something gets cheaper, it is not time to sell, it is time to buy. 

Think about a pc, do you buy when it is almost Christmas, when prices are high, or afterwards when they fall? Buying activse must follow the same logic, but with extra care.

Another advise: unless you're pretty sure, don't put all of your eggs in the same basket. Have some money to invest? Buy your bitcoin, but do not put all your money on it, unless you're an expert in bitcoin and its economics.

2022-01-14 01:57:51,"I calculated what bitcoin is worth in energy Here are my calculations. Please let me know if there are any flaws.

Average energy cost based on google = **$0.138**
Energy consumption of an antminer S9 = **1500 watt hours**

Every 10 minutes a block gets mined.
1500wh / 6 / 1000 = 0.25 kwh  Multiplied with the average price = $0.138 x 0.25 = **$0.0345 per block per antminer**

Currently the hashrate of bitcoin is around 180 million TH/s. Let's say everyone who mines uses the same antminer with 140 TH/s = 180'000'000 / 140 = ~**1’285’714**. That's the amount of antminers that are needed to produce 180 million TH/s.

1'285'714 x $0.0345 = ~**$44’357**
That's the price of the energy that is being used to produce one block.

The current block reward is 6.25 bitcoin. $44'357 / 6.25 = ~**$7'097**

It is circumstantial I wrote a book review on Finn Burton's [Digital Cash](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Digital-Cash-Anarchists-Technologists-Cryptocurrency-ebook/dp/B07MDHTPB9). Turns out it teaches us a great deal about historiography and the ontology of money.

Read my review [here](https://www.jack-chong.com/blog/on-digital-cash-historiography-and-ontology-of-money/).

\- Balaji is wrong. Technological determinism is the wrong philosophy of history 

\-Web3 is NOT decentralized 

\-Value fundamentally is data

2022-01-14 06:27:21,"How does inflation affect Bitcoin? Let's talk about inflation and it’s direct impact on Bitcoin. The current inflation rate is \~6,8-7%.

The inflation rate is rising, and this December’s rate was **the highest since June 1982**. 

If prices grow by 7% per year, **this means that in 10 years, all goods will become \~2 times more expensive.** You can say that rising salaries offset inflation, but this is not the case because they have grown by only 4.7% this year.

The Federal Reserve System (FRS) says that as soon as the problems with the supply chains caused by the Coronavirus are resolved, the situation will stabilize. Still, the new variant of Omicron is exacerbating the situation the Coronavirus is progressing.

Due to these events, the dollar is becoming weaker. **If we look at the USD/BTC chart, we can see that the dollar gets weaker against bitcoin; therefore, Crypto enthusiasts often talk about bitcoin as a hedge against inflation.**

2022-01-14 10:09:44,"Why you should be using your Bitcoin for transactions when given the choice **TLDR: 
Use lightning as a checking account when given the option and immediately exchange fiat to replenish funds. This removes value from the circulating fiat economy and into the Bitcoin economy. If your spending is small % of savings tax implications should be minimal or positive**

People seem to think that you should always purchase things with fiat rather than Bitcoin because it is the weaker form of money. This is nonsense. **As long as there is liquidity to exchange fiat for BTC the opportunity cost is exactly identical**. Any money you spend is money that could’ve gone towards stacking sats, whether you exchange it or not. 

I expect within the next year we will start to see more wide scale adoption of lightning by retailers, online services, and individuals. The network is gaining liquidity, it works, and the financial incentives are there. *When* this happens we should all make it a point to *reward* that effort in the form of lower fees for merchants and more liquidity for the network to encourage **transferring as much value as possible out of fiat and into Bitcoin where it cannot be fucked with**. 

Learn how lightning works. Get a lightning wallet. Make your friends pay you those $20 they owe you in sats instead of Zelle or Venmo. Be ready. There are enough bottlenecks to adoption without you being one of them. 

Now I know you’re thinking “But taxes..!!!”. More nonsense. 1. You only pay taxes on profits, so as long as you’re buying extra Bitcoin specifically for spending this just means you made more money. 2. Most places including US let you pick what method to use for calculating your BTC price (LIFO etc.). DCA + volatility means there’s good chances to declare losses or at least minimize gains taxes.

El Salvador will officially adopt Bitcoin as its legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar starting Tuesday.

&amp;#x200B;

Bitcoin rose as much as 1.39% Monday afternoon to more than $52,600, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. Reuters market analysts see it on track for $56,000-$56,300.

&amp;#x200B;

Earlier on Monday, Bukele tweeted that ""our brokers will be buying more as the calendar deadline approaches.""

&amp;#x200B;

El Salvador will officially legalize bitcoin on September 7, a move Bukele said could save Salvadorans abroad millions of dollars in remittance commissions when they send money back home.

&gt;“We are going to launch Crypto Rio and invest 1% of the Treasury in bitcoin,” Paes said.

The 52-year-old member of Brazil’s Social Democratic Party praised Suarez’s efforts to transform Miami into a cryptocurrency hub. The latter previously [said](https://cryptopotato.com/miamis-mayor-open-to-explore-investing-1-of-citys-treasury-reserves-in-bitcoin/) he is open to exploring the idea of putting 1% of his city’s Treasury reserves in bitcoin.

While Miami has positioned itself as the cryptocurrency center of the USA, Rio aims to become the South American hub for the digital asset industry, Paes asserted:

&gt;“Rio de Janeiro has everything it takes to become the tech capital of South America. Events like the Rio Innovation Week come to strengthen the city’s image as the perfect place to work, live, and innovate.”

The possible bitcoin adoption is considered a massive step for the development of the primary cryptocurrency since Rio de Janeiro is the financial heart of Brazil. Its economy is also one of the largest in the Latin American region and among the fastest-growing globally.

Bitcoin solves this problem with a fixed amount of coins set at a low inflation rate that counts in half every 4 years. Low supply equals higher value. Bitcoin mimics the fixed amount of Gold within the earth's crust in a modern digital format. Simple yet effective.

So many people are complaining about the cost of living soaring yet barely anybody presents Bitcoin as a solution.

**Executive Order 6102** is an [executive order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)) signed on April 5, 1933, by [US President](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_President) [Franklin D. Roosevelt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt) ""forbidding the [hoarding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoarding_(economics)) of [gold coin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_coin), [gold bullion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_bullion), and [gold certificates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_certificates) within the continental United States.""

 The stated reason for the order was that hard times had caused ""hoarding"" of gold, stalling economic growth and worsening the [depression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression) as the US was then using  the [gold standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard) for its currency.

Regardless, I am very close to reaching my first goal of an amount I’d like to have and then it’ll be onto the next milestone of the amount of bitcoin I’d like to have.

2022-01-15 08:29:09,"The Fed’s interest rate hike expectations are rising, and it is no longer a decisive factor for Bitcoin? Fed rate hikes intensify.

&amp;#x200B;

On January 10th, Eastern Time, Federal Reserve Chairman Powell spoke at the hearing, saying that the economy after the epidemic may be different from the previous expansion, the US labor market is strong, and policies must be considered forward-looking, and tools will be used to support the economy and employment. market. In fact, since the Fed released the early signal of raising interest rates last week, the market's expectations for interest rate hikes in March have begun to rise sharply.

&amp;#x200B;

Goldman Sachs now expects the Fed to raise interest rates four times this year, in line with analysts at JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank. A tight labor market and rising inflation have fueled expectations that the Federal Reserve will become more aggressive in raising interest rates and shrinking its balance sheet. Bloomberg Economics said in a report that the Fed is expected to focus on its balance sheet at its January meeting and shrink it this time or sooner.

&amp;#x200B;

The panic and turmoil in traditional markets spread to the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin once broke below the $40,000/piece mark, the first time since September 22 last year, a drop of $29,000 from the high point in November last year, and a drop of more than 5% within the day. The market generally believes that once the Fed officially starts to shrink the balance sheet and raise interest rates to ""cool down"" the market, risk assets including cryptocurrencies may usher in a decline in expectations.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Bank of America strategists like Michael Hartnett believe bubbles are bursting at the same time in assets including cryptocurrencies, palladium, long-duration tech stocks and other historically risky market sectors. Jay Hatfield, portfolio manager at Infrastructure Capital Advisors, said the reduction in liquidity from the Fed will lead to higher equity risk premia and interest rates, which will continue to disproportionately hit the market's riskiest assets, including money-losing tech stocks, influencers , especially momentum-driven investments in cryptocurrencies with no intrinsic value.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, there are also different voices. Gu Yanxi, a researcher and practitioner in the blockchain and encrypted digital asset industry, said in an article that don’t pay too much attention to the impact of the Fed’s policy on the price of Bitcoin. Bitcoin price is affected by many factors, but the Fed's policy is not the main factor affecting Bitcoin, because there is enough money in the market to determine the price of Bitcoin. This is similar to the Fed's policy will not affect the issuance of Tether. Even if the price of Bitcoin moves due to the announcement of Fed policy, the causality is spurious and temporary.

&amp;#x200B;

Gu Yanxi said: “If a major global regulator takes regulatory measures against a major cryptocurrency exchange, it will have a much greater impact on the price of bitcoin. But even so, the impact will be very short-term. .""",-0.9978256821632385,0.09192239858906524,0.39461860670194004,0.061,0.046,0.893,0.8436

Examples the report gives is chinese miners moving to the clean and hydroelectric-rich Sichuan area during wet season and a possibly flaring to be used as a energy source for mining.

Coming to the question:

After couple of halvings block reward  (ie; newly generated coins as i understand) and transaction fees wont be able to pay miners electricity bills. In that case mining farms will shutdown their machines and hashrate will fall.  But price of bitcoin will also rise and miners will continue to mine even if price falls below mining cost as history has shown us. But some day bitcoin price will find saturation and newly generated coins will definitely not pay electricity bills. 

isnt it ok to say network will be become vulnerable. however LN and other sidechains will continue to work. 

What i worry is we have seen hashrate going up we havent seen the other way round. Now some kids will say u would be dead before that happens. Then why generational wealth narrative is pushed so much.

verification requires user to check part of a hash Merkle branch.

user need to send the private key,

then not only at the nodes but also at sending can cause a problem.

And also if the user wants to check the hash is right,

I was thinking, what if there was a way to use Tor concepts in real life face to face exchanges. E g. a person stakes some Bitcoin on some decentralized escrow protocol, and then volunteers to onion route cash for facilitating Bitcoin sales.

When A wants to buy Bitcoin from D on bisq or lightning, the Bitcoin part is all secure, but the face to face cash part is difficult, and risky. In this mechanism, if there is an App that finds a random, obfuscated route between A and D, lets say involving B and C.  App then tells A to give cash to B, without disclosing it is for D. Then app tells B and deliver it to C. All the while, like lightning, B and C getting a commission for this routing.  And money they are moving is always less than the Bitcoin they have staked. Eventually it reaches D and transaction is committed on bisq or lightnig.

The major benefit over A meeting directly with D is when government wants to prevent people from transacting in Bitcoin, and is actively seeking to stop such transactions and/or arrest the people involved, or simply to be able to identify and track them, for harassment and fear ongering. But in this approach, the physical exchanges are also obfuscated ad hidden from trackability.

Only the people that I think would legitimately hear what I say and consider the ideas. So far it’s working fantastically. My friend Justin and I use to run a small business together. Was successful in terms of profit but we decided as a team it wasn’t worth our time and effort; fast forward to today and we are partners once again. As we go over planning and execution again I decided to mention the idea of taking BTC as a main source of payment wherever possible and we could use it a savings account to build the business down the line as well as wherever possible pay with BTC. He was hesitant at first but after I described the network and how everything works to the best I could he slowly opened up to the idea. When I asked him to download a wallet right then and there to show him a first hand visual of transfers and the benefits of hard wallets he was on board.

I work at a Chinese restaurant as a delivery driver/second manager. Very old school business. So old we have no type of computer and and a 30 year old register. My boss (who is also one of my closest friends) is the owner/first manager of the restaurant and over the course of the last 7-8 months I’ve been slowly convincing him to read up on and buy Bitcoin for himself. Recently I struck the conversation of trying to begin accepting BTC as payment. Again hesitant at first but he has  finally agreed to do it recently and he seems to be very excited to be moving forward. I like to believe I convinced him to go home and do enough of his own independent research to finally make the move. 

It has been a very pleasant experience learning about Bitcoin and I’m proud to say I’m doing my part where I can to help the world move towards Bitcoin as a universal currency.

**1**: It’s way easier to hodl if you understand bitcoin. You really have to be convinced about it to sleep well after a 50% dip and smile because you get btc on sale.

**2**: I realised that I never had anything in my life that made me that passionate like btc. That’s why I want to work related to it. I am a student of business informatics (just basic coding skills and I don’t really like coding). I want to ask people of this space, which jobs can be done by people like me and how do I get them? It’s so fu…ng important for me to work in this space, in every other job I do I start to lose my interest after a couple of weeks.

2022-01-17 08:26:31,"I had this idea of potentially reducing Bitcoin footprint. ***I want to start off by saying, I am posting this to understand why it would not be feasible.*** 

As things stand, difficulty dynamically adjusts to ensure that blocks discover generally hits the targeted 10min mark.

https://preview.redd.it/tykpn0ifp5c81.png?width=734&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da4427506cb8c0edda6b16c17b00d157cba95992

The graph above shows 5 blocks discovered where the time is the sum of a, b, c, d, and e. The blue are is where active mining is going on, until the discovery, represented by the orange line.

On average, all the letters represent roughly 10mins, before a discovery is made.

If we reduce the difficulty, but maintained our hash rate, the graph would change to this:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rychgblhq5c81.png?width=338&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7bd3ba0aae55fe41cd1236722d53b96eb1bdf4bd

Now the average time to discover a block, is reduced greatly, however, the odds of discovery a block first based on your hash rate, remains exactly the same, relative to everyone else, as it did, when the difficulty was higher.

Lets continue to decrease the difficulty, where the discovery of a block becomes almost instant.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9edqfe0gr5c81.png?width=122&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=26683eb849a3273033381ab7a63ae587f7cd1b30

At this point, the average time to find a block is around 1 second, but once again, if all other things are unchanged, the odds of anyone discovering a block first remains exactly the same as when the difficulty was higher.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, one could argue, that all the mining up to the point of discovery of the block, where **absolutely** meaningless, and the only mining that is relevant, was the mining that was occurring at the exact moment the discovery took place.

Taking that reasoning into account, then what we can do, is adjust the way we think of mining.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6sblkc1kt5c81.png?width=717&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=648dd107eb0c8ff7806e0193a2b4df4ba45545e0

If we apply the logic above to when the average time to discover a block was 10mins, we can argue that up to the point of discover, all the mining before that point, might as well never happened. 

Now the way we take advantage of this logic, is to introduce a time out logic, which states that after the discover of block, no one mining can occur again for 9mins. During this time, miners go on standby and their hash rate falls to zero.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/o1scq8c7w5c81.png?width=1442&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b44c73d88d2d93495f74870652b85f2172d02d30

Now with the difficulty and hash rate remaining the same, what we end up with is an average time x plus a constant timeout value of t, which gives us roughly +/- 19min time to discover a block.

Now since our target is the 10mins, lets reduce the difficulty that with the exact harsh rate, the average time to discover a block is 1min.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zr9kpnkaw5c81.png?width=702&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bdb06eb905cb60735dceeeff9adc8f0b5457d855

Now, what we have, is the same discovery time, same hash rate, same odds of discovering a block, but 90% less mining.

However, to further ensure a that we maintain the integrity when mining was constant for all, we introduce an additional phase, called the transition phase. This phase gives all miners the heads up to gear up their hashing, so at the instant, the window is open to mine again, everyone is already at full throttle. This phase which can be 1-10 seconds depicted by the green bar below

&amp;#x200B;

Large mining farms were closed, but mining machines were not confiscated and most were moved overseas.

Mining from small home graphics cards continues, but in some provinces the network will be cut off when the network company finds your mining.

There was a huge amount of bitcoin and miners confiscated by a corrupt provincial official, the official was arrested causing the sharp drop in May. This is well known in the Chinese news.

Short: Introduction of  a new identifier between 'bitcoin' and 'sat' named 'subby' with a comma displacement of 4 instead of 3.

&amp;#x200B;

Now and then, a discussion ensues about how (sub)units of bitcoin should be named. I noticed that it often revolves around being either one of the following:

Variant a) scientific notation: BTC, mBTC, µBTC etc.

Variant b) use BTC plus an identifier for the smallest unit of measure, e.g. bitcoin and sats

Arguments for each are usually in line with being 

Variant a) scientifically correct, but nobody would use it

Variant b) better  usability  in everyday life because of being easy to pronounce

Unfortunately, Variant b would probably be used more often, if  pricing  wasn't so cumbersome oftentimes. A 4.30 USD coffee would be either

1) '0.000116 bitcoin' - too many zeros

2) 11600 sats - too large of a number

&amp;#x200B;

So I suggest introducing  a concept with a new unit **right between a whole bitcoin and its smallest denomination** (which shifts the comma by 8 places). It could be called ***subby*** or something and would **move the comma by 4 places** instead of the usual 3.

Please have a look at the following examples.

[coffee example](https://preview.redd.it/s4eugnrak8c81.png?width=1186&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1da927a365cca57aa822ef1144fb60667e44dad5)

&amp;#x200B;

[car example](https://preview.redd.it/wba8tvz5r9c81.png?width=1302&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b15422dd605b658be5a9facccbff8c5ae920e70)

So what are the pros and cons?

**Pros**:

* fits right in the *middle* of Bitcoin's smallest and biggest units
* rolls off the tongue easily
* 'bitcoin' and 'sat' are all widely settled terms, so only the term 'subby' needs to be discussed/agreed upon

 **Cons**:

* moving the comma four places instead of  three from/to subbies is counterintuitive and would probably create confusion or could be used to fraud people 

&amp;#x200B;

Please take it with a grain of salt. The idea here is just to introduce a new(?) way of thinking. It's not in the scope to agree on any specifics.

https://preview.redd.it/08x744x5kdc81.jpg?width=759&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b8d83c5ccd40b79e9d6a63721e90bdf942c0971

The blockchain transaction may be viewed [here](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/tx/7dff938918f07619abd38e4510890396b1cef4fbeca154fb7aafba8843295ea2).

The price was calculated by computing how much it cost in electricity to mine that amount of BTC. At the time $1 of electricity would buy you 1,309.03 BTC. The transaction was facilitated by a service called New Liberty Standard. Basically the first exchange.

Today it is estimated that it costs anywhere from $7,500 - $11,000 to mine just 1 BTC. Using the lower estimate, that means it is now nearly 10 million times more expensive to mine Bitcoin (hardware included), but it is still profitable because the BTC sells for at least 4x your electricity and hardware costs. Of course, large mining operations have greater expenses than just hardware and electricity.  James from InvestAnswers mentioned in a [recent video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKoupgtbiHM) about miners that they should be profitable all the way down to a 25K USD price per BTC.

2022-01-18 23:52:49,"Bitcoin + Lightning = It will still NEVER be able to scale?! We have 2,000 transactions per block in Bitcoin. That's every 10 minutes, so 6 blocks per hour and 144 blocks per day. That means we have about 288,000 transactions per day. And with 365 days per year, that's 105,120,000 transactions per year. Sounds like a lot at first, but how much is it really...? Here are a few thoughts:

Let's assume that Bitcoin will eventually have 1 billion users. That would be about 12% of all people according to the current population. These 1 billion users would like to send a transaction now and then. But with only about 100 million transactions (as calculated above) we would need 10 years until everyone could carry out a transaction.

Of course this depends on the size of the mempool and the more you pay, the faster you get your transaction into a block. But the fact alone that it is theoretically only possible for everyone to carry out a transaction on the main blockchain every 10 years is somewhat worrying.

Some might bring up: ""That's exactly what the Lightning Network is for."" But ok... To open or close a channel, you also have to run a transaction on the main blockchain. This means that, in the best case, it would only be possible for everyone to open or close a channel once every 10 years.

There is no other way. We only have these 100 million transactions per year. So, unfortunately, not everyone of the 1 billion people will be able to make a transaction, not even in 10 years. So they will also not be able to open or close a Lightning Channel.

My question: Is this really a problem or do I have a thinking error there? Are there any possible solutions to this? Or is it just impossible for Bitcoin to scale to this extent and 1 users is just way too big for Bitcoin?

Would appreciate any answers! :)",-0.9947807192802429,0.16013888888888891,0.58,0.056,0.084,0.86,-0.8214

Below is the result of an orange pill orgy involving myself, two old-fashioned country club types, one curious billionaire, a Romanian dancer, and an incredible view of Central Park from the 48^(th) floor of a W. 57th Street apartment. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/njltlsoqujc81.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e9ec743bd2f56138993ec0e6e195b3fac5b07f6

I showed up hauling an 80-pound gift that I worried was out of place for such a fancy domicile. Even the doorman combed over it with suspicion. “It’s not a bomb,” I assured him. It wasn't a powder keg, but a quarter barrel keg of *New Glarus* beer from Wisconsin. And it was a hit. Everybody loved it, neglecting the aged whisky in its pretty glass decanter, and in some telling forsaking the fancy wine too. Instead it was a scraped metal barrel of delicious pee-colored liquid sloshing around a kitchen floor and making smiles. My only regret was not stopping to buy some red plastic Dixie cups on the way. The apartment was mostly empty of furniture save the living area, but what we made of it felt like a writer’s room might, everybody throwing out theories, strategy, plots, etcetera; except the protagonist was bitcoin, and the villains anything that might stand in the way of its escape velocity. I learned a bunch. Here’s the billionaire’s full bitcoin portfolio:

* *SunPower, Enphase* 
* *Intel*
* *Riot Blockchain, Marathon Digital with OTM LEAPS calls sold on both*
* *Short Gold via ETF*
* *Long silver via ETF*
* *Long bitcoin with 25% on an LN channel. 25% in cold storage. 50% on Celsius where half is used to collateralize a loan, the proceeds of which are spent hosting several S19 miners through Compass Mining, with earnings going directly to the LN channel.*
* *Cash held in stablecoins at 8.8% APY on Celsius which is enough to both cover inflation and service the bitcoin loan. This can also be used for any out-sized BTC dips (-50% or more)*
* *Real Estate (land and homes) in Puerto Rico*

All the above makes up over 80% of his entire portfolio. The rest was the apartment I was standing in, Apple, and Amazon stock. The apartment building was designated special tax status (421-a exemption), and the stocks allow for quick loans whenever cash is needed, which means he avoids selling the stock and causing a taxable event. 

So that’s a peek into what the other side is up to. Anyone care to decipher this portfolio for us?",-0.5722691416740417,0.11450577200577203,0.4864213564213565,0.104,0.055,0.841,0.9718

Would it be possible for a country to launch a timed OTC buy with several exchanges and scrap of 10-20% of those btc before the exchanges knows what is happening?

Let's say 200.000 Bitcoin valued total OTC price at $8,400,000,000

The fact is, a lot of sophisticated investors are already having bitcoin exposure in their portfolio without being aware of it. I don't have the proof, but I guess if I did a little homework, I can show that Charlie Munger owns bitcoin directly in his portfolio through one of his many subsidiaries. It might not be substantial in terms of weights, but bitcoin is becoming unavoidable. 

So either people can embrace it and be enlightened, or hold out until the very last minute and let it ""force"" into your live. The choice is rather straightforward imo. 

Bitcoin is the one and only thing throughout human history that when its value goes up, the supply does not follow. It's been INCREASINGLY enforced for 13 years and it's now solid af. There is no next best thing; bitcoin is the only thing. No one will wanna catch up with a 13 years handicap thus all these shitcoins are trying to do something else. A few of them might work, who knows. But 99% of them will fail that's for damn sure.

One point that I seem not to find much info on is Bitcoin decentralization. Obviously there is a massive hash rate, the recent china ban has been great for diversification of mining actors and removing potential Chinese control of pools.

However I’ve seen statistics stating that 3 or 4 of the largest minings pools today could collaborate for a 51% attack. 

Now I understand that that would be against their own economic interest but I could foresee a scenario where hostile governments can take over some of these pools and force things.

Do we know how these pools are controlled? By who and where? 

Is there anything I’m missing in terms of decentralization risks? 

In case a pool does misbehave, besides miners leaving, are there any other mechanisms to influence them? Would there be warning signs?

From reading online, it looks like DriveChain allows Bitcoin to evolve into any alt-coin within a layer-2 sidechain, which can even follow different consensus rules such as proof of stake. To me, it sounds like an excellent concept for Bitcoin to utilize all of the desired features from the alt-coin world and maintain its dominance. 

However, are there any significant flaws around DriveChain that we should be aware of? 

From what I have read online, it looks like layer-2 could be vulnerable to a potential 51% attack for the Bitcoin deposited there. I imagine this flaw could be resolved similar to how Bitcoin manages a 51% attack risk by having more independent miners working on the chain?

Let's be honest, I've been in this space for over ten years and nothing has made me buy more Bitcoin than FOMOing in at the top. In the long run, it's never mattered. When I was a newb, the dips would scare me yes, but I kept DCAing in anyway. However, when we hit peaks, that's when I really started FOMOing in my full paychecks during my DCA buy ins.

I don't expect to stop that tradition anytime soon. So while you're all waiting for $10k to go all in, I'm staying true to my bad old habits that will never die and have served me well. I'll Fomo in everything I have just as I've done every time before. In the long run, it's always never mattered how high I bought in at anyway. So as my motto goes, buy high and never sell.

So eff all the waiting for the dips to buy mentality. My DCA amount stays the same no matter how low we go, because that's how dumb the emotions and decision makings of my monkey brain are.

2022-01-21 04:14:41,"I buy Bitcoin BECAUSE I'm an environmentalist First, lets preface this by saying that ""environmentalism"" is neither a left nor right thing. Rupert Murdoch might have taught some people to hate but it really has more to do with understanding human impacts and the hidden costs of business than it does politics.

I learnt about Bitcoin on the first day. Spent half the day trying to figure out where the source code was or how to compile it, then moved on with life. 

Then for the next few years I thought to myself ""It's a waste, we can't just burn that energy for nothing of value"". Relatives asked over xmas dinner what I though, I told them. I wasn't a stanch objector but I also was very sceptical and dismissive.

One thing which expanded my understand was this [""talk by Gunter Pauli on what he calls The Blue Economy""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W73_kGaDb5U). The idea being that everything ""green"" is expensive. We have boutique products or difficult supply channels which profess to be ""green"" but if they're expensive and exclusive then this can not possibly be any kind of solution for the future.

**Instead good business should run like an ecosystem. Waste should be converted into new revenue streams. In doing so positive outcomes for habitat should be cheap and readily accessible.**

This is where Bitcoin comes into environmentalist thinking, it adds revenue to waste. Without revenue being attached to waste there is no commercial imperative to adopt any kind of practice to consume such waste. 

In the global economy we find ourselves in, the only way change is affected is through profit. You can't force people to do things, you can't subsidise your way to meaningful change. The only thing which works is having businesses exploit opportunities for profit.

Through this mechanism Bitcoin is increasing grid efficiency and providing a consumer of last resort for greenfield renewable projects. This kind of change was difficult to even dream of even 10 years ago let alone 20. Many thought that consumption for consumption's sake would continue to consume the world's resources without paying any of the hidden costs.

Now we have way by which energy production can be cleaned up at a profit. This is world changing on more levels than the value provided by a censorship resistant, decentralised, permissionless, trustless ledger.",-0.9994454979896545,0.039659796725014115,0.4109213250517598,0.114,0.102,0.784,0.7573

I was in the arena, to see how Bitcoin was going to be treated, and that was a Dog and Pony Show compared to this.  Great questions, and they got real people, with boots on the ground in the Bitcoin space to speak, unlike in 2018, when they got a bunch of professors , pontificating, but they were talking out of their hind quarters, never having use Bitcoin before.  Just a bunch of lip service.

I stacked a tiny amount for her when she was here, opened an exchange account for her and showed her how to use her own wallet instead if keeping all on exchange. I then explained to her about how fiat is designed to inflate and why she worked 6-6 daily without weekends for 35 years but retired with not much in her savings. I didn’t think she would be orange pilled though. 

For context:
- In the first half of her 35 years of working and running various small shops, Vietnam has “changed money” a few times, each time cutting one to a few 0s in their banknote. During these period of cutting 0s, everyone needs to hand in all the cash and get back a capped amount. In September 1985, another zero is dropped and as a single person, you can exchange all the cash you own to get back 1500 VND. One USD was equal to roughly 1 VND back then. In 2022, 1 USD roughly equals 22000 VND
- In the second half of her career, the government put a cap on their monetary policy, inflation was tamed down to 3-7% a year. She keeps working 12 hours a day, 7 days a week
- This year the government is talking about temporarily suspending inflation cap to “fight Covid”

Here are her choices to even hope for a storing enough value for retirement :
- SP500 or foreign stock markets: Not possible as a Vietnamese 
- Real estate: Not enough cash
- Gold: Possible
- US Dollar: Possible but Gov controls how much you buy or sell
- Vietnamese stock market: Possible but very young market with min investment of 100 units of stock at a time, account can be suspended at short notice
- Saving account in cash: Possible 
- Bitcoin: Possible to purchase for the time being

Today she calls to talk about DCA small amounts she doesn’t need immediately and I am a proud daughter. 

On the one hand, I was sad to see a loved one worked so hard day in day out for 35 years without a sure retirement. On the other hand, the experience gave me a completely different perspective on why Bitcoin is needed.

I know Bitcoin is dropping again today but guess what?

Recent advances in quantum computing “has enabled us to make predictions which are unheard of in terms of accuracy” said the 56 years old Professor of economics. “We clearly came to the conclusion, that it is most likely that bitcoin will go up if it doesn’t go down.” His colleague, Professor Hernandez from Berkeley said that “this is one of the most important findings in economics since the Keynesian economics. I would be really surprised if Professor Strand wouldn’t be considered for this years’ Nobel Prize”. We also asked Matt Tucker, whose best friend in high school had a dog who once peed against the fence pole of Mr. Miller. Mr. Miller confirmed that these findings are a breakthrough in understanding how cryptocurrency markets work. He believes that there is only one exception to this rule: “In rare occurrences a phenomenon called ‘sideward movement’ has been observed”. Young researchers would need to complete Professor Strands theory to include this. According to the bitcoin reddit, the future of bitcoin is golden.

What happened in 2017 has been the most utilized fractal for a lot of people in the crypto space. So, a lot of people were disappointed when last month, we did not moon.

But, there was a trend last year that actually did not happen in 2017 and this was not discussed that much. I am talking about the early Altcoin season.

If we think about it, that happened because as the monetary value and the market cap of BTC are increasing, it dissuades more people who want to earn as quickly as possible from entering BTC. 

And those people did earn. The BTC did correct in May. It recovered and printed a new ATH. But, demand is still going to Altcoins instead of BTC.

So, without enough demand, BTC cannot moon. 

So, if that is the case, what is the best way to correct this? 

Blast the December-to-the-moon narrative and start 2022 with a downtrend.

And the altcoins followed down down down. And I am pretty sure some shitcoins and scam coins died in the last few weeks.

Right now, the grand plan of Bitcoin is to reverse and gain a big portion of the dominance back.

I wonder though if that is possible with plain price action. 

I think Bitcoin will need big positive news to do it. That way people will have a reason to conclude that Bitcoin is really the King. That Bitcoin is safer.  

And I do think, there is a lot of potential big-time news. Like, intelligent big-time investors know that the right time to buy is when people are in fear, right?

The crypto space is currently in fear. So, lookout for the initial release of FS in Q1. That could be the thing that we are waiting for.

Overall, we can say that BTC is trying to correct the greediness of the Crypto space and refocus them on what truly matters.

Michael Saylor may discover he actually owns too many bitcoins. And when he and other overexposed whales are forced to sell due to the change in valuation the buyers will be those who have the least bitcoins. And they'll be buying on the cheap!

It's how bitcoins are getting spread out into the hands of more and more people making it a fairer system. And it's the exact opposite of how things work in a fiat system with inflation where the money actually does make the rich richer.

You should not hoard bitcoins! You should not be over exposed and over leveraged where price fluctuations can force you to sell low. Because if you are, your bitcoins will move into the hands of those who aren't when you will need to settle your debts and buy your food, clothes and shelter.

I haven't been in it as long as some, but since becoming fully orange-pilled around last August I have put everything I can spare into Bitcoin. I've also reallocated a lot of existing assets into Bitcoin as well. My average price is around $45k and while this recent dip makes me a little sad I'm not particularly worried. I don't think this has much to do with Bitcoin's fundamentals anyway since everything is crashing right now.

But I do get to thinking about what it would take for me to lose faith. Like if Bitcoin were to drop below $1k and remain there for an extended period of time, I would be seriously questioning things. Something would have to have happened to cause BTC at that price to not be quickly bought back up by retail and whales alike. I can't even begin to imagine what scenario could cause that because Bitcoin can't be stopped by any bans or regulation.

Or what if something else comes along and flips BTC in market cap by like 10x? Some centralized shitcoin that we all wrote off gets mass adoption and legal tender status in some major economies. Would that be enough to make you question your faith? 

I don't want to hear why these scenarios will never happen. I already don't think they are in the realm of possibility. I want to know what it would take for you to stop buying BTC, no matter how far fetched the scenario is.",-0.998450517654419,0.06723057644110275,0.4974937343358396,0.108,0.067,0.825,0.908

2022-01-22 21:26:47,"my mom just spent $617 on bitcoin, she's stoked about her $600 in bitcoin! https://i.imgur.com/3NC1Son.jpeg

it's already valued at $578.59 which is worth $577.10 btc! to the moon!

haha true story. with the state of the market, i told my mom it was time to get in on the action. if you want the full story, read on:

my tale begins when bitcoin first started making the news, around 10 years ago is when it entered my radar. i was immediately curious and started learning because technology cool.

i pretty quickly discovered bitcoin fountains (which are apparently banned on this sub so don't ask me about them) and made a wallet and started farming. i was young and it was a neat waste of time. eventually i got bored and forgot about it.

years later, bitcoin is all over the news again, all time high, etc. i wonder about my coins, get back into my wallet, boom, i forget how much exactly but like, 50-100 usd just sitting there. i didn't even have a bank account so i just bought stuff on the internet from vendors that accepted bitcoin. admittedly, i bought myself 1 month of reddit gold just to see what it was.

i really just wanted to use it and support businesses accepting it because that's how you get acceptance. i had no interest in investing, just wanted to play with magic internet money. eventually there's just a few dollars and cents in the wallet, and i forget about it again.

well, again, years go by, bitcoin news, ath, i find my wallet again and boom, $200+ available. amazing. i honestly can't figure out the math on this one. looking back, comparing prices and trying to remember when i did it, none of it adds up, but i spent the money, this time i did cash out because i had a real world emergency. checking the wallet was actually a last ditch effort just to see and it saved my butt.

i did check the wallet around 69k and there wasn't much.

okay, side story, somewhere during this time, my family started a business. we have always been poor, no investments, no generational wealth of any sort. my family of 5 worked for free to build a business out of our childhood home, and it worked. we're not rich by any means, but we are more comfortable.

once, during a profitable time, we had an extra $10,000 and we were deciding how to use it for the business. i suggested buying 1 btc, as it had just hit 10k, and was shut down pretty quick. about a week later, btc had about doubled.

i was never rude about it or anything, but my mom recently told me how terrible she felt for not listening to me. when btc was pushing 69k, she again reiterated that she wanted to get in if i ever thought there was a genuine opportunity.

well, today was a day. i woke up, read some news, and texted her that i thought it was time. when she woke up, she responded. i was clear that she could lose every penny she paid, that the price could continue to go down for a long time before it ever goes back up. i called it an entertainment fee, but that the more she spent, the more entertainment she would get. i also explained how the exchange owned her coins and that she would need to do extra steps to have actual ownership, which she hasn't done yet.

i expected $10-$100 just to get in on the hype, but joked that 4 figures would flex on plebs. she didn't know what that meant but kept hitting the buy button until her cc got limited at 6 $100 purchases plus fees.

don't worry, i explained diamond hands, we ain't no paper handed family. im just really happy we have bitcoin now.

# The Article (for those who can't view):

Many don't understand or trust Bitcoin, or shun its huge fees. There are worries that the global money-laundering police are poised to crack down, and the experiment has so undermined confidence in its showboat president's economic program that his nation's debt is now selling for 36 cents on the dollar. Yet many of the crypto community's most influential commentators are still praising the daft scheme. In a recent interview, ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood raved that adopting Bitcoin has more than doubled the ranks of Salvadorans ""with access to new banking services and new financial services.""

El Salvador was doing fine with the dollar when Bitcoin became “forced tender”

It's important to grasp how the new Bitcoin regime upended a period of stable money and forces banks and merchants to accept a wildly volatile currency they don't want, and that can't work. In 2001, the Central American nation of 6.4 million made the daring decision to scrap the colón and ""dollarize"" its economy by taking the greenback as coin of the realm. ""I had a hand in that,"" Steve Hanke, professor of applied economics at Johns Hopkins University told me. Indeed, Hanke played a pioneering role in counseling Latin American governments on the benefits of embracing the dollar some 20 years ago. He had previously served as an adviser to the minister of finance in Ecuador when El Salvador's neighbor adopted the dollar in 2000—Hanke's known in Ecuador as ""the Dollarizer."" Around that time, he discussed the impact of making the move at length with El Salvador's finance minister Manuel Hinds, a former World Bank economist and a close friend. Hinds was the architect of his nation's landmark conversion following shortly after Ecuador embraced the buck.

""El Salvador made the dollar legal tender, but it allowed any other currencies to be legal as well,"" says Hanke. But the shift to dollars worked great, banishing any thoughts of using an alternative. Over the next two decades, the nation enjoyed average inflation of just 2.03%, mirroring the U.S. trajectory. Its mortgage rates were stable and moderate for a developing nation at 7%, and its economy—though plagued by widespread poverty—grew at better than the average of its Latin American neighbors.

Despite that exemplary monetary record, following his election in May 2019, then 37-year-old President Nayib Bukele hitched his economy's future to Bitcoin. Last June he pushed through a law that made Bitcoin a second official currency. But the rules applying to Bitcoin marked a stunning departure from the former template that had worked so well. Bukele, a former publicist who sports baseball caps worn backward, blue jeans, and aviator shades, is a self-styled revolutionary who called himself ""the world's coolest dictator"" before switching monikers to ""CEO of El Salvador."" His new law wasn't about choice. It requires all merchants and banks to accept Bitcoin for payment from any consumer or other business that wants to pay with Bitcoin. ""Even today, no one has to accept the dollar for payment,"" says Hanke. ""So Bitcoin isn't legal tender like the dollar. It's forced tender. It's what the Soviet Union imposed in banning all other currencies, or what nations demand when they conquer other nations.""

As we'll see, the forced use of Bitcoin will prove its downfall. The banks that have no choice but to accept Bitcoin won't be able to comply with the stringent, looming rules that would make the king of crypto unworkable inside El Salvador's borders.

The reasons for adopting Bitcoin were bogus

""The big question is, 'Why would you use Bitcoin in the first place?'"" asks Hanke. ""Why would you want to change anything?"" Bukele's justification was that the newcomer would greatly improve ""financial inclusion"" by giving a wide swath of the 70% of Salvadorans who lack bank accounts access to financial services. At first glance, Bukele's main argument appeared to make sense and drew international acclaim that made him something of a folk hero in crypto circles. El Salvador's economy relies heavily on ""remittances,"" payments to families from relatives or friends working abroad. Those transfers account for one-quarter of its GDP, the highest share of any country in the Western Hemisphere. Bukele wrongly argued that the processors exacted huge fees that greatly diminished the dollars his people collected from Western Union, MoneyGram, or Ria. Deploying Bitcoin, he trumpeted, would make remittances far cheaper, leaving more money for Salvadorans and ushering millions into the financial mainstream.

""That was a typical lie,"" says Hanke. He cites that El Salvador's remittance costs rank sixth lowest in a survey of 104 countries at 2.8%. ""The law backfired by greatly increasing remittance costs using Bitcoin,"" says Hanke. But he adds that it accomplished Bukele's true objective by strengthening his grip on the nation: ""He forces his enemies to follow the Bitcoin law, and if they don't, he puts them in jail, and he lets his friends ignore the law.""

Bitcoin’s downsides: Businesses and consumers don’t want it, and it’s incredibly expensive for remittances

Bukele attracted users by giving everyone who signed up for the government's app a $30 bonus in Bitcoin, held in a digital wallet called Chivo, El Salvadoran slang for ""cool."" ""He had to bribe people to sign up,"" says Hanke. But the millions who got Chivo mostly cashed $30 in crypto for dollars, and dumped the app. One problem is a widespread lack of familiarity with Bitcoin. A survey by Central American University found that nine out of 10 Salvadorans didn't know what Bitcoin was, and that eight in 10 didn't trust it. The government frustrated potential users by botching the launch in September. Folks couldn't exchange their Bitcoin for cash when the app frequently failed to connect to the nation's few Bitcoin ATMs. Nor did folks embrace Bitcoin for what was advertised as its main appeal: low-fee, superconvenient remittances.

In fact, dispatching funds in the virtual coins is shockingly costly—on both ends of the transaction. Exchanges such as Coinbase charge the sender commissions of 2% to 4% for changing dollars for Bitcoin. When the Bitcoin arrives in San Salvador or Santa Ana, it posts in the recipient’s Chivo wallet. But the Salvadorans don't want Bitcoin. So they go to an ATM, where they can use the app to get dollars. The ATM provider takes a 5% cut, and pays more fees to the network that handles the exchange from coins to dollars. Hanke puts the total cost at 7.0% to 9.5% a transfer, as much as three-and-a-half times the expense of traditional remittances, and he thinks even 9.5% may be a low number. And that doesn't include the inconvenience of traveling to the ATM, which are scarcely distributed, or the risk of getting mugged while counting your cash. Over 80% of the people surveyed by the El Salvador Chamber of Commerce said that they don't want remittances in Bitcoin, and over nine in 10 rejected the idea of taking their salaries in coins.

Global policemen may soon crack down

Hanke predicts that the anti–terrorism-and-money-laundering police force that spans national borders will soon put El Salvador in the penalty box. When the intergovernmental Financial Action Task Force (FATF) finds or suspects that a nation engages in such wrongdoing, it places its government on a ""gray"" or ""black"" list that imposes severe reporting requirement on banking and business transactions, and especially those in virtual assets. For Hanke, a signal that the FATF may be ready to pounce is a U.S. State Department's conviction that Bukele is heading a corrupt regime. Bukele's handpicked legislators recently nixed a law barring presidents from successive reelection, contrary to the nation's constitution, and in response, the State Department issued a scalding press release titled, ""Salvadoran Re-Election Ruling Undermines Democracy.""

""Now, El Salvador is positioned to violate the FATF's virtual asset regulations,"" writes Hanke. If it goes on the gray list, he says, its banks and businesses will face two dozen tough reporting regulations that will be virtually impossible to fulfill. ""The Bitcoin transactions are all about anonymity,"" he says. ""If the FATF takes action, anyone who opens an account will have to comply with 'know your customer' rules that require the disclosure of the source of the funds and details on every transfer."" In his view, an FATF crackdown is practically inevitable and would kill any chance that Bitcoin could serve as a viable currency.

El Salvador’s finances are in shambles

The heavily indebted nation is seeking a $1 billion loan from the IMF and also courting aid from the World Bank. But Bukele's getting nowhere with both, and the IMF has strongly criticized his crusade to create the first Bitcoin-powered economy. In late November, Bukele unveiled his nuttiest idea yet, a plan to build a Bitcoin City on the Gulf of Fonseca, funded by a $1 billion bond offering, $500 million of which would be deployed to speculate in Bitcoins! Practically overnight, the price of sovereign bonds dropped from 75 cents to 63 cents of their par value, on its way to its current level of 36 cents. ""El Salvador now has the most distressed sovereign debt in the world, and it's because of the Bitcoin folly,"" says Hanke. ""The markets think that Bukele's gone mad, and he has.""

The tragedy in El Salvador shows that Bitcoin's a disaster for buying and selling things, and that the dollar's a matchless currency. For a while, a flamboyant promoter marketed his fantasy to other zealots who want to believe. The test was selling it to his own people. They weren't buying.

# My own thoughts:

I'm not sure if El Salvador is handling this the perfect way, but remember they are the first country to enact Bitcoin as legal tender so in a sense it is a big experiment and there are bound to be hiccups. However I don't think *forcing* people to use bitcoin as tender is the right way to go because it obviously causes more resentment than positive associations. Unfortunately, I think this will have negative impact on the course of any countries trying to implement the same system in the future.

TL;DR: regulations will actually help make them mainstream and attract investors, decentralisation is the shit, and lack of inflation/transaction hassles/sending money across borders make cryptocurrencies a nice long-term proposition for 2030 and beyond.

Yeah, I know. Title sounds preposterous, but hear me out. I'm not going to use convoluted numbers, projections or charts to defend this - but instead three very simple propositions.

1. Over the next few months, central banks and governments are going to start meaningfully regulating crypto (many already have). You might think that this could be a detriment to their value, but don't be so sure. What do you do when you regulate something? You imply that it is, in some form or capacity, legal and doable. At this very moment, there are countless potential investors of cryptocurrencies around the world - who haven't yet participated because they're either unaware of the technologies underpinning them, or their legality, or so on and so forth. Point is, once cryptocurrencies are integrated into legislature - people will likely flock/switch from common asset classes to digital currencies like the world was ending the very next day (a second sequel, perhaps, to the first Bitcoin craze in the latter stages of 2017 and the second in the early stages of 2021).
2. Secondly, they offer something that no equity, commodity or derivatives contract in the world can even begin to - decentralisation. I don't know about you, but I actually like the notion of an authoritarian government not being able to freeze my assets on a whim - or obtain a glaring access to my transaction histories on a tenuous warrant. Can that be misused as an avenue for certain crimes? Sure, but they're avenue - not a cause; the value that they add to the world far outweighs all of it. People are going to start buying them - not for purposes of holding and selling, but for everyday transactions. It might take time, but it'll happen.
3. And finally, all their associated characteristics: potential hard-caps on supply to safeguard against inflation, ease and liquidity of transactions (ie. sans government/bank-induced hassles), self-governance, 24/7 exchanges, transferring money across borders and so on and so forth. Really, they're right up there.

Are they volatile? Yes. Can they go close to touching zero? Maybe. Are you an idiot if you're trying to enrich yourself by trading them in the short-term? Absolutely. But if you have a reasonable horizon to look forward to (2030 and beyond), they **are** the bloody future of the world economy.

As an anarchist, I actually believe in them. And even if I'm wrong about this - I'm willing to part with some amount of money to embody that belief.

A slow accunlmualiton phase, a sky rocket after the halving, then a ""crash"" to a level *above* the previous point. And repeat. 

What's different though is we've never had global market crash whilst Bitcoin was alive. The Dotcom crash. The financial crisis. Bitcoin has never lived through these and so thus far we've never seen the effect it would have on Bitcoin.

The March 2020 crash may give us a glimpse into what could happen. Bitcoin was not immune and lost about 40% of its value.

In the coming year Bitcoin is, for the first time, going to get hit by a double whammy. An economic crash *and* a crypto winter happening at the same time. This has never happened before. All previous models for understanding Bitcoin may break here, and we could see a drop to *below* the previous cycle.

2022-01-23 10:18:38,"Bitcoin IS behaving as an Inflation Hedge and here are my reasons Bitcoin IS behaving as an Inflation Hedge

To put it plain and simple.

A lot have been written about Bitcoin nature as Digital Gold and an Inflation Hedge, or just a speculative asset.

These theories appear to be invalidated by this last week crash, some say Bitcoin is correlated with the NASDAQ, which is true, but not mutually excluyent with the fact that Bitcoin IS behaving as an Inflation Hedge. And at the same time, Bitcoin IS a speculative asset. 

The fact that Bitcoin is falling when the markets expect a rise in interest rates, is a proof of that. What consequence do rising rates have in economy? Theoretically, less inflation and a stronger dollar.

If that happens, then, again, theoretically, there is no reason to have as much Bitcoin (inflation hedge) as before, when the market expected (2020 and beyond) a falling dollar and a rising inflation, as a result of the money printing. An in that scenario, everyone bought Bitcoin as a HEDGE.

Finally, the fact that Bitcoin is not only falling but crashing, is a proof that it is also a speculative asset.

Bitcoin long-run uptrend will keep going, but with a stronger dollar and less inflation (at the least that’s what the market expects; I don’t think that a shy rise in rates can contain inflation) in the mind of the investors, we can’t expect crazy bullruns from Bitcoin in the short term.

What YOU think can be different, but definitely, the big capitals and institutions are expecting rising rates, a stronger dollar and less inflation.",-0.9996320009231567,-0.07925170068027211,0.36933106575963714,0.113,0.047,0.84,0.9579

2022-01-23 15:22:08,"What happens when all Bitcoin are mined? So I'm relatively new to all this so forgive my questions if they are stupid.

Am I right in thinking that costs go up at each halving because basically it gets twice as difficult/expensive to mine bitcoin?

Cost can go only go up if the market is willing to pay that price, right?

It is predicted that all Bitcoin will be mined by 2140. What happens then? Bitcoin miners would no longer get blockrewards and only get fees for transactions. How would that still be profitable for miners? If miners turn off their rigs, what happens to the security of the network?

What impact would quantum processors have on this equation? I guess it would just happen a lot sooner than 2140?

Quantum processors would definitely help to make bitcoin more efficient but then they would also help any nefarious people who wanted to hack the system. Surely we need a similar amount of hardware dominance within the network to maintain the level of security. 

I suppose that really bitcoin needs to establish a global network of powerful quantum computers that run on very low amounts of electricity to counter any attacks on the system. This would need to be in place before bitcoin is completely mined. If the miners themselves got to this point, and the fees were enough to remain profitable due to minimal electricity and maintenance costs then I could see this working.

2022-01-23 15:54:25,"What's the investment thesis for Bitcoin long term? Hi.

Why would we expect Bitcoin to increase in price over the next 10-15 years, and not slow and steadily decline before being put out of existence?

I've followed Bitcoin for years, and know quite a lot about it's strengths such Andreas Antonopoulos' ""The Five Pillars of Cryptocurrency"". I also know that that a lot of rich individuals, companies (like MicroStrategy) and even countries (like El Salvador) it buying bitcoin, but still I see some risk factors that makes me question bitcoin's future:

1. As we have some very big whales such as Max Kaiser which can probably move and manipulate the market for decades to come, why would even more countries and such move to bitcoin and risk being at the mercy of such individuals?
2. Despite bitcoin's superb, unique qualities (ref the five pillars) which does solve some real problems for real people (especially in developed countries), why would we assume that Bitcoin will continue to be the crypto dominating this space, and not being replaced by another crypto for this segment of bitcoin users? I mean, bitcoin is great and all, but being the first (and as of now the biggest) in the market for say hedging against government induced hyperinflation, doesn't mean it will stay this way.
3. If you subscribe to the notion that fiat money per definition is doomed due to inflation and government control, it's possible that bitcoin will remain an investing hedge by (wealthy) individuals and companies, and not become the money of the future. If so, it's possible that bitcon remains just a regular investment asset along side stocks and so forth.

I'll stop there, but I hope you see where I'm going with this. For me, there's a lot of ifs when it comes to the future of bitcoin, and a lot of resources I find online seems to totally ignore risks like the ones I mention above, so I though I'd reach out to the crypto community to get some input.",-0.7801785469055176,0.13055555555555556,0.500508547008547,0.094,0.082,0.823,-0.3089

This is what is preventing me from going balls deep into BTC right now. Otherwise fear is high so it's a great time to buy more.

I mean if BTC was a ledger shared between 10 friends with an agreed price of 1$ = 1BTC, settled monthly. We all know there is no way to alter that shared ledger. But there still can be a bad friend who never pays his monthly share or pays just half of what he is owed. When he does that, the dollar value of all other people's 'Bitcoins' goes down. 

If translated to a market level this is what is happening right now. Except there was never an agreed value of a BTC.

I know it doesn't matter if BTC turns into a global currency with a stable price. But what would that stable price be? Why will it remain stable? When can it be expected to be reached?

Another pet peeve of mine is when people associate the mining cost of Bitcoins with its value. Just because something is hard to obtain doesn't automatically makes it valuable.

2022-01-23 20:58:45,"Understanding Bitcoin Price Through a Macro Lens Hi everyone.  I see a lot of concerned comments from folks in the community lately wondering what's going on with Bitcoin price, and a lot of responses that try to explain things either through references to external events in the news cycle, chart analysis, whale activity, wild leaps of conspiracy theory, or flat-out trolls that BTC is dead.

I'd like to see if we can't crowdsource a more macro-economic narrative, backed by data and reasonable hypotheses, to add to the discussion.  I don't claim that any of what follows is infallible or the best way to look at things; but it is hopefully a decent place to start the conversation.

This is a 5-year view of the M2 money supply, consumer spending and real (inflation-adjusted) production, in aggregate dollars:

 

https://preview.redd.it/nw1l512w3gd81.jpg?width=1242&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=18b20a60e96b7afb8d4a0b352a1b3f80c214b94b

A few things here.  A massive increase to the money supply beginning with the onset of the pandemic in response to cratering consumer spending and overall productivity.  Recovery is fairly sharp.  Consumer spending is actually materially up versus an imagined and extended pre-pandemic trend line.  Real GDP is roughly on trend.  Money supply, however, is up 40% from pre-pandemic levels, and about 26% from the accelerated trend-line we see starting in about 2019.  **The question is:  if all of this excess money is not driving expanding productivity or increased consumption, where is it going?**

We see the need for this question also if we look at what's happened to the velocity of money, because it's certainly not being transacted at its usual rate.  This is Bearish.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9by0432n6gd81.jpg?width=1242&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e528336de175baf89901350774b1811af29c9378

I think there are a couple of different answers.  First is increased money hodling in both the public and private sector.  This is Bearish.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/898ksglg9gd81.png?width=1168&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8085b1769d8e3b4c20f95eaaebe43cabee279f1b

Second, excess capital has also been taking on unprecedented levels of risk in search of yield, pumping investment values to extreme levels.  Consider the current valuation of the stock market across four key valuation indicators in historical context.  This is Bearish.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ajty74jyagd81.jpg?width=3131&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e8f91d0781d703c5958e0d6120b4452a9434423

Note the rocket-like trajectory of valuation coming out of the initial pandemic crash and coinciding with the rapid increase of the money supply.  Note the extreme downside risk implicit in a reversion to mean.  Why would anyone continue to take on that kind of risk in the pursuit of even more upside to these already crazy valuations?  Especially given the Fed's recent announced accelerated interest rate increases that will better reward hodling, better protect the value of money by hopefully curbing inflation, and is basically throwing in the towel that the productive economy will be able to grow at a rate that would justify these kinds of valuations.

So where does that leave us bitcoiners?  Unfortunately, we are being disabused of the notion that BTC is currently consensus seen as a secure store of value, but is rather consensus viewed as speculative growth tech.  I believe this upcoming period of time will be critical.  BTC is acting somewhat like a canary in the coal-mine for the economy overall, and the bloodbath price action we are seeing in it right now will spread more aggressively to other areas.  The big test will be when the shit really hits the fan everywhere in a period of protracted pain.  That is when the consensus view will swing or be confirmed, and when the value of bitcoin will be realized or lost.

I have been stacking and hodling BTC since 2017 and will continue to do so.  But it's going to continue to be a wild ride.",0.7246947288513184,0.08241341991341991,0.46884199134199134,0.118,0.062,0.82,0.9896

There is one thing that bothers me with bitcoin: Isn't inflation a game-theoretical prisoner's dilemma? If I can gain a short- to medium-term technological advantage over other states by ""printing"" tons of Fiat Money, opting out of a hard money system is a dominant strategy.

F.e. The US abandoned the gold standard to maximize their ressources on war. 

My question is: Why should a state decide to get rekt by other states short term when FIAT makes you like unstoppable?

The only solution I see is that Bitcoin has to be adopted worldwide without even 1 state sticking to Fiat. And I dont think this is likely.

2022-01-24 16:46:27,"Bitcoin / ""Crypto Winter"" or ""Crypto Ice-Age?"" **What's happening with Bitcoin and Crypto space?**  

Investopedia defines a “Bear market” as one in which securities prices fall 20% or more from recent highs amid widespread pessimism and negative investor sentiment. 

Bitcoin touched $68,789 on the 8th of Nov. 2021. As of now, it is trading at $35,036, a decline of over -49%. While this is alarming no doubt to the HODLERS, it comes as no surprise really. Bitcoin is known as a volatile asset and has seen 7 previous bear markets with price declines ranging from -49% to  -86%. 

What’s different with this time’s correction of $33,753 (and counting) is that it is the largest ever downswing in dollar terms overshooting the previous decline of $33,043 in 2021, that coincided with Elon Musk’s tweet that Tesla would stop accepting Bitcoin as payment. However for the current decline, there is no one specific reason, but multiple factors that have spread a cloud of gloom over Bitcoin and the whole crypto space. 

The free fall in crypto current has erased more than 1 trillion dollars in market value. The question being asked among crypto enthusiasts is this over? Or is it a “long crypto winter” or alarmingly a “crypto ice-age?”  

**What factors are negatively impacting the crypto space.?**

· In the Dec. 2021 FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) meeting, made known the Fed’s hawkish announcement to fasten the pace of paring its bond purchases. This results in a larger number of bonds being available in the market, resulting in lower bond prices. With lower bond prices, the yield or return on bond increases, and thus the money flows away from the stock markets into bonds that are considered safe and risk-off assets. What has this to do with crypto? Before 2020, Bitcoin/Crypto moved independently of the stock markets. However, since then, the correlation is gradually increasing (from .01 to .36 – up 17 times). And thus a  rise/sell-off in the stock market has an influence on the crypto space as well.  The International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned in its blog post that sentiment in equities and crypto appear increasingly connected, raising the “risk of contagion across financial markets.”  

·  With the rise in inflation, the Fed has no choice but to raise the interest rates. A Reuters poll showed that the Fed would likely raise its key interest rate three times in 2022, to 0.75-1.00% by end-2022. Rising interest rates, impact crypto as well as other “investing assets” as long-term bets look “less attractive” and investors look for safer investment avenues.

· In 2021, crypto was a hot sector for investing. The overall crypto space saw a record high net inflow of $9.30 billion. With high liquidity chasing a few good investment themes, asset bubbles were formed that saw astounding annual gains ranging from 100-10,000% and 15,00%+ even. Astute investors booked profits and exited with gains, leaving latecomers to hold bags or exit at huge losses. 

· The current geopolitical situation is not favorable for “risk-on assets” including Bitcoin and crypto. Russia has a huge military build-up on the border with Ukraine. There is a real fear that with the Russia-Ukraine crisis, Europe is 'close to war' in decades. Any Russian invasion of Ukraine, will divide and destabilize Europe and create economic instability worldwide, in a world battling the covid pandemic as well the China-Taiwan tension.   

· The Bitcoin fear and greed index is at 11, showing extreme fear, as many leveraged traders have their accounts wiped off. Many first-time investors would have also cut their losses unable to withstand the large price correction and the currently prevailing negative sentiment.

So the question remains what happens to Bitcoin and crypto from here on? 

Whenever there is a great decline in the price of an investment asset, there is a high volume of selling as investors head to the exits. Then there is a long period of low volume as investors stay away and there is little money flowing in for investment. This decreased volume and the lower but stable price is an indication that a bottom is being formed. The process of bottom formation takes time, sometimes weeks, months, or years even.   

For long-term investors, it is a time to buy in small tranches in projects they have confidence in without trying to time the market. 

Though the news of the interest rates hike and Fed tapering has been factored in, the other key event to watch is the resolution of the Russia-Ukraine issue. A peaceful resolution of which will help create a positive sentiment to Bitcoin and the crypto sector.",-0.999386191368103,0.0911650016650017,0.45503629703629683,0.125,0.101,0.774,0.9698

2022-01-24 18:26:25,"Is this the Grand Plan of the world elites in maximizing Bitcoin? Let us begin with an easy question. How can you earn the most from Bitcoin? You should buy it at the lowest price possible, with the most amount of volume and sell it at the highest price possible.

Now if you are one of the world elite, how will you try to enter Bitcoin? Dollar-Cost Averaging? This is risky for them. Reputations are on the line. Bitcoin, even at the level that it has reached, is still not a well-embraced concept. And going back to the first paragraph, world elites are not looking to be wise. They are looking to maximize profit and power. 

Assuming that a portion of the world elites (politicians, business moguls, bankers, influential people/NGOs) are actually connected in a way, behind the scene, what is the best plan to maximize BTC?

The answer is again, the first paragraph. To enter at the lowest price possible and to initiate the embracing of Bitcoin as the new gold by the entire world. 

**How will you do that?**

**STEP 1**

The first process is to crumble the price of BTC. Did they manipulate the price last year? 

Not really.

Do you know the reason why BTC failed to land on the moon last 2021? Because the supposed demand that will push it to the moon, never came.

With how big BTC's market cap is, BTC needed the dollars from the big banks and institutions to buy. Looking back at the analysts or personalities that you are following at the start of 2021, they cannot stop talking about the Institutions that they are expecting to buy-in in 2021. 

 But, thinking about it now, there is no way that the world elites will take that role because that role will not maximize value. 

And they know, they do not really need to do anything for them to get the price of Bitcoin that they want. They just simply need to sit back and not put the demand that BTC needed to erupt to the six digits territory. Without demand, the current whales in BTC will need to make their decisions. And then nothing happened in December. So, the confidence of retail is really down.

And the price fell. 

Yes. I think we are now approaching the price that the World elites wanted to buy into Bitcoin. Don't ask me how low they want it to be. I do not have an answer.

**STEP 2**

The second process of legitimizing Bitcoin as the new gold or to simplify, their process of mooning the price, is actually a much easier endeavor for them.

Because of the fact that more than 90% of the people in the world are not yet into Bitcoin. It means that only around 10% of the entire world is suffering right now with its sudden downturn.

The majority of that 90% (let us assume that it is 90%) can easily be persuaded to enter into Bitcoin. 

How?

By the world elites entering into Bitcoin. Just imagine the big companies in the world. The big banks in the entire earth. And the biggest nations that are ruling us, announcing that they have bought Bitcoin. What will be the reaction of that 90%?

Will they question Bitcoin's legitimacy? Not anymore. 

Those smaller businesses, banks and nations, how will they react? Of course, they will need to buy too. Or else, they could be suffering greatly in the near future. 

And then the ultimate piece of the puzzle could be Bitcoin surpassing the market cap of gold. Once Bitcoin has a much higher market cap than Gold, plus the acceptance of the World elite, the narrative of Bitcoin being the modern gold will be unstoppable. 

And then, the final piece of the puzzle.

Bitcoin/gold is supposed to be a hedge against inflation.  

And inflation is here. A widely accepted hedge against inflation is available for everyone to buy. What will people do if inflation continues to be there?  


**CONCLUSION**  
This idea will be proven this year. If the world elites will still not enter Bitcoin, then the idea is just a wild imagination. 

Nevertheless, personally, I will continue to work hard and earn as much money as possible to buy Bitcoin. I do not think that this opportunity for life-changing scenario will ever come again in my lifetime.",-0.9997289776802063,0.10979467801501701,0.4352966713136205,0.062,0.035,0.903,0.9619

2022-01-24 23:15:06,"A simplified analysis on acid, on why we might be at the bottom Bitcoin price range for the rest of this four year cycle’s bottoms. Potentially to only see this $30k price range 2 more times from here, before the 2024 halving's supply shock pressure causes the next price range tranche up in 2025.  

Okay so first of all, before we get into this, the acid I'm on at the moment is called ""Limitless"" like in the movie, so lets see how this goes. But I would take all this info like you're hearing about it from a guy who is high on a hallucinogenic drug and tripping out of his mind while enjoying chart patterns. So in essence, throw it all out the window and assume it has no merit. Okay so here we go:

[Here’s some charts to visually show the patterns](https://imgur.com/gallery/ClsW81h)

The last low in the previous circle was in the $3k price range. It’s the lowest price range that we saw 3 times in 3 price corrections of the previous cycle, before we had this latest run up this cycle into the new price ranges that are in the tens of thousands of dollars.

If we repeat that pattern, we potentially have a blow off top in the six figure range, somewhere like $200k+, then crash back to the $30k range two more times between now and twenty twenty five (2025) when we’ll be jumping to sit in the six figure range fluctuations(Hundreds of thousands range)

We’ll see though, nobody can tell the future, but this is the long term pattern I’m noticing or hallucinating off this acid.

If it’s right, then this is the best buying range opportunity we’ll have two more times over the next 3 years. Which means that We may only see this price range two more times after this in those next 3 years.

After that, the next low might be in the $300k range from 2025-2030, just like now it’s potentially the 30k range, and before this it was the 3k range. Before that the low was the 300 dollar range, before that the 30 dollar range, and before that the 3 dollar range.

History doesn’t repeat itself exactly, but it does rhyme. this rhythm is what allows analysts to see where things can potentially go. Take everything with a grain of salt though

If this pattern shows to be fruitful in the long term, I’ll name it “The Rising M Pattern”, or “rising enough to quit McDonalds pattern”

If the pattern is a descending M pattern, then this in the past has meant what I call the “expect to work at McDonalds for a bit longer pattern”, before the next halving’s supply shock kicks in and starts the next cycle’s price range pressures",-0.9992319345474243,0.15124986124986126,0.39457930957930964,0.058,0.059,0.883,0.3824

I mainly came to Reddit for the anonymity it CAN offer and usually some intelligent conversations that CAN come from that. I also like the feeing of a more close knit community in subreddits than the tons of users on other platforms. Twitter CAN function the same way but with way more yelling/hate and usually less anonymity. But for whatever reason bitcoin and crypto seems much more accepted on twitter vs Reddit and other platforms.

A general misunderstanding of the technology/energy usage, to what bitcoin aims to accomplish, and straight up defending the current system I’ve seen in r/news and r/technology is disheartening. 

At the very least, I don’t know why people can’t see the system is setup to make it very hard to get ahead and getting harder everyday (priced out of homes, university prices with an roi of 5-10 years if you’re lucky, stagnant wages, ever inflating currency).

Idk I just thought Reddit would be a social platform that would embrace a technology willing to try to change the currency, possible for the better. Almost a “rooting for the little guy” approach.

2022-01-25 03:59:03,"Never forget - bitcoin is an algorithmic advance for humanity The algorithm for distributed trust, unleashed by satoshi in his genius whitepaper, is an algorithmic advance for humanity.  The invention of the computer was big.  Then the internet connected all these computers together, even bigger.

&amp;#x200B;

But now, for the first time, it is becoming possible for all the computing power on the planet to work in harmony to create utility for mankind.  That's a game changer.

&amp;#x200B;

Think about how many potential computations go wasted in just your own home.  Most Americans, and many more worldwide, own a desktop computer, or a laptop, or a smart phone, and many own several.  These devices sit mostly idle today, because if they aren't working for you, they don't know how to work for everyone and get you paid to do it.

&amp;#x200B;

With distributed trust, we have a computation model that allows that potential to be unlocked.  We can use it for:

\- security / robustness / decentralization of our money and our applications

\- cutting out middlemen and their corruption and fees

&amp;#x200B;

... and so much more.  Imagine training an AI algorithm, but instead of ""just"" a cloud of computers at Google, you use the compute power of the whole planet!  What kind of value will be unlocked?

As more people understand this novel model for computation, the clever ones are going to find even more applications for this stuff.  Decentralized computation will be the standard, and that right quick.

&amp;#x200B;

Beyond utility though, bitcoin offers hope for humanity.  Poor people with access to renewable resources can now monetize those directly, offering a huge financial incentive to switch to renewables.  Economies between humans will more easily cross country borders, and that shared economic interest can help reduce tensions in a world full of nukes and dictators.

&amp;#x200B;

Bitcoin is our path forward, together.  To me, it's the only way.  I used to be skeptical that humanity would last long.  Now I am optimistic, now that we have figured out how to compute collectively.  I have a USCD savings account, I borrow money on defi as a mortgage, and I store my value in bitcoin (among others).  I may not be an OG, but I've had all my buying power in crypto long enough to have seen multiple 7-figure swings up and down.  I don't care.  This is the way.  And it can't be stopped any more.

Within the last few weeks, bitcoin drops to $33,000 from $50,000. Even before it went maximum of $69,000.

Just assume the current price of bitcoin is $50,000. According to what I understood, to it becomes $49,000 someone needs to buy bitcoin for $49,000, and someone needs to sell him to for $49,000.

There will be a lot of people who need bitcoin for $49,000 since the current price is $50,000. But who wants to sell bitcoin for $49,000 instead of $50,000 since the current price is $50,000.

Fed tightening, regulation cloud the outlook for crypto

 The chilling term refers to a sharp slump, followed by a drop-off in trading and months of market doldrums -- a phenomenon that memorably befell the crypto market in 2018. Bitcoin’s price plunged by more than 80% to as low as $3,100 from the end of 2017 through December of the following year, a period characterized by the boom-and-bust of initial coin offerings and several big banks shelving their plans to start cryptocurrency trading desks. Bitcoin wouldn’t reach a new high until December 2020, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. 

 Memories of 2018 are sparking fears that a repeat is playing out now after the world’s largest cryptocurrency plummeted 50% from its most recent high of almost $69,000 in November. The crypto universe has shed more than $1 trillion in market value on growing conviction that the Federal Reserve is set to start ratcheting back the ultra-accommodative policy settings that fueled a boom in risk assets. The pullback has hit all corners of the crypto ecosystem, from Bitcoin to memecoins and publicly listed crypto exchanges. While the collapse has been rattling enough on its own, it has spawned an even bigger concern that the pain may persist for many months, according to UBS. 

 

“There’s this question of how do we characterize that and the nearest analogy is probably 2018, which is this idea of a crypto winter,” James Malcolm, head of foreign exchange research at UBS, said by phone. “It looks likely to be a fairly difficult and potentially prolonged period and therefore, the crypto winter analogy is quite good. Remember, the crypto winter in 2018 wasn’t just over the Northern Hemisphere winter months. It basically extended for a whole year -- so it was a crypto winter that lasted effectively a year.” ",-0.9887523055076599,0.1312539184952978,0.48021421107628004,0.052,0.059,0.889,-0.4951

2022-01-25 09:45:49,"A reminder of the real value of Bitcoin over altcoins As Bitcoin dominance continues to slowly crawl back up, this is just a sober reminder of the value of Bitcoin.

If you were to put a large wager on which crypto will still exist in 100 years, hands down, there is no competition. Bitcoin can survive almost any assault placed against it and can do so orders of magnitude better than any of the leading altcoins.

If you want to make bets on which alt will pump before it inevitably fizzles out in the next 5 years or gets replaced with a competitor, then go invest in alts. You're betting on a centralized dev team, with centralized governance, and a base layer so filled with complexity that it can break at the least opportune times. You carry those risks in perpetuity. It's like investing in stock in a company, nothing wrong with that, but it's not currency.

If Bitcoin is like investing in land, alts are like investing in a finished home.

Flood? The land is still there. Earthquake? Land still there. Do you want to build a skyscraper? Take your land and use 2nd and 3rd layer solutions, don't mess with the base layer. You want a centralized entity to provide some additional layers, use Coinbase or PayPal with a Bitcoin reserve.

If you're buying a house, you need an engineer's assessment. Do you trust the engineer? Do you trust the builder? What's the plumbing like? Why would you add this complexity into the base layer? The more moving parts, and the more people you need to trust, the more things can go wrong. You can build anything on land, but every time you want to develop your house, you need to retrofit, take things down, and deal with obsolete elements. That is an altcoin for you.

Just buy the land and forget about it. When the tech is here for whatever fintech solution you are looking for, you can just sub in Bitcoin at the base.

Listen at minute 41 if you are interested in hearing Schiff's argument directly.

Schiff pejoratively categorizes Bitcoin as a pure collector's item. I found this fascinating for many reasons made clear with a comparison to gold.

Originally, Gold was purely a collectors item. Some people valued it because they found it's physical properties interesting and it allowed them to hold or create an object in which they could physically store value due to its relative scarcity. Over time, we discovered that gold had additional physical properties beyond being shiny and scarce that made it even more valuable.

Bitcoin right now is mostly still in the collectors item phase. People value it because they find it's systematic properties interesting and it allows them to hold an asset which can digitally store value due to its absolute scarcity.

The difference between gold before the discovery of it's industrial properties and bitcoin now is we do not need to discover anything additional about Bitcoin to anticipate its future value; we can recognize them in the present by looking at its source code. We know what widespread adoption of Bitcoin will mean for individual sovereignty, freedom from coercion and theft from the state, and its properties as a medium of exchange. When you buy bitcoin, you are implicitly saying that you believe you should be able to actually own something that no one else can take away from you. The downstream implications of this are deeply philosophical, paradigm shifting, and potentially a catalyst to increase human freedom and reduce suffering. That is the value that we can see in the present with bitcoin.

Gold has some properties that Bitcoin doesn't have which give it real physical value (side note this is what I think people are really saying when they make the claim gold has real inherent value and bitcoin doesnt). Bitcoin has some properties that gold doesn't have which give it differentiated digital, and I would argue social, value. Both had to start as collectors items, because the only kind of money that doesn't start in that manner is fiat. Fiat doesn't have to start as a collectors item because you are forced to value it or the state will take your societal privileges away.

So in summary, I think Bitcoin is in fact a collectors item at the current moment and that isn't a bad thing, it's a necessary step in the progression of a non fiat asset becoming a money.",0.9332752227783203,0.14101851851851852,0.43707671957671956,0.139,0.036,0.825,0.9929

1. [Trader University](https://www.youtube.com/c/TraderUniversity)'s videos are college lecture style from someone who has a long background in finance so he actually knows what he's talking about. No clickbait, no shitcoins, no sensational titles or thumbnails. Just the cold hard facts. His videos aren't going to entertain you, but you will end the video smarter than when you started watching.
2. [Simply Bitcoin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7PWaVk09c0) is a daily webshow where a group of Bitcoin maximalists cover current events that are related to Bitcoin. They do a great job at keeping it entertaining, while going indepth into topics and news.
3. [Bitcoin Magazine](https://www.youtube.com/c/BitcoinMagazine/videos) is the Youtube channel for Bitcoin Magazine. They film and livestream Bitcoin conventions, and recently they started hosting a daily webshow on Bitcoin similar to Simply Bitcoin (although I prefer Simply Bitcoin's show).
4. [BTC Sessions](https://www.youtube.com/c/BTCSessions/videos) is a channel focused more on covering the Lightning Network, wallets, and other applications interacting with Bitcoin.   
5. [Dan Held](https://www.youtube.com/c/DanHeldBitcoin/videos)   is a top executive at Kraken who just happens to be a Bitcoin maximalist. He often has very insightful opinions since he is such a big insider in the industry
6. [What Bitcoin Did Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/c/WhatBitcoinDidPodcast) is a podcast hosted by Peter McCormack where he interviews prominent people in the industry. My only criticism is that he never asks tough questions when he gets the opportunity to talk to people in positions of power.
7. [Off Chain with Jimmy Song](https://www.youtube.com/c/OffChainwithJimmySong/videos) is a channel where Bitcoin developer Jimmy Song talks about Bitcoin and sometimes interviews prominent people in the industry.
8. [Swan Signal](https://www.youtube.com/c/SwanSignal/videos) is a channel that discusses Bitcoin markets fundamentals.
9. [Tone Vays](https://www.youtube.com/c/tonevays) is a TA channel that hosts livestreams everyday. He also invites friends on to discuss current events.
10. [Toxic Airwaves](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmA84qt35hSxBSxsXRCkWsg) is a webshow where two toxic Maximalists host a webshow and talk about anything they want, often with a conspiracy bent.

2022-01-26 04:02:32,"Bitcoin is HOPE! | Monthly DCA Strategy till 2030 Dear Bitcoiners,

Today I had an amazing realization! Going straight to the content - In the end I calculated the average monthly Bitcoin return from 01.01.2014 to 01.12.2021. Bitcoin had in average 6% monthly return. Checking from 01.01.2017 it was even 9% monthly return. Then I checked the yearly return and Bitcoin made in average around 80% from 2014.

&amp;#x200B;

So now comes the magic! Compound interest!  
Setting:

\- Buying Bitcoin every month for 100€ until 01.01.2030. (approx. 8 years form now)  
\- never sell and assuming a monthly return of 6% the hole time.

We start on 01.01.2022 with 100€.

On 01.01.2025 we would have approx. 12.700€.

On 01.01.2028 we would have approx. 115.000€.

In the end, on 01.01.2030 we would have  XY BTC worth approx. 500.000€

&amp;#x200B;

What do I want to show with this idea? It is very simple to invest a small amount over some time and in the end we might get financially free. (Depends on the country) We invested 9.800€ during these 8 years, but COULD gain 500.000€ purchasing power in total!

Bitcoin is the opportunity like buying Amazon, Apple, Facebook like 20 years ago! DO NOT MISS THIS LIFETIME OPPORTUNITY! 

&amp;#x200B;

So guys.... HODL in a cold wallet and BTFD! Do not care about the current price! Look into the future and enjoy life with your family and that even more when you made it to 2030 without selling any Satoshi!

Robert Kiyosaki, the author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, tweeted Sunday about the price of bitcoin and when he will buy more [BTC](https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC).

Rich Dad Poor Dad is a 1997 book co-authored by Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter. It has been on the New York Times Best Seller List for over six years. More than 32 million copies of the book have been sold in over 51 languages across more than 109 countries.

Kiyosaki wrote:

He added that silver is the best bargain today, emphasizing, “Silver \[is\] still 50% below high.”

Kiyosaki has been warning about a major crash for many months. In December, he [said](https://news.bitcoin.com/rich-dad-poor-dads-robert-kiyosaki-depression-coming-predicts-gold-silver-bitcoin-real-estate-crash/): “Crash and depression \[are\] coming. Gold, silver, bitcoin, real estate will crash too.” In November, he [warned](https://news.bitcoin.com/rich-dad-poor-dads-robert-kiyosaki-buying-bitcoin-ether-inflation-escalates/) about inflation, adding that he plans to buy “more gold, silver, bitcoin, ethereum, rental real estate, and oil.”

The famed Rich Dad Poor Dad author said in June last year that the largest bubble in the world’s history is getting bigger, tweeting: “Biggest crash in world history \[is\] coming … [Waiting for bitcoin](https://news.bitcoin.com/rich-dad-poor-dads-robert-kiyosaki-biggest-crash-in-world-history-24k-bitcoin-price/) to drop to $24K.” In October, he [advised](https://news.bitcoin.com/rich-dad-poor-dads-robert-kiyosaki-warns-us-sliding-into-depression-after-giant-crash-recommends-bitcoin/) investors to prepare for a giant crash followed by a depression, adding: “Be smart: Buy, gold, silver, bitcoin.”",0.7805402874946594,0.26567219817219817,0.5390396023729357,0.116,0.117,0.767,0.399

All of these articles, videos, MSM and information are saying that Bitcoin is ""stealing power"", ""a waste of energy"", ""a carbon footprint"" etc.

It's a trick. 

The left wing media are giving us negative Bitcoin articles because people want to save the planet and clicks make money.

The right wing media are probably buying bitcoin right now.

But really, the whole narrative about Bitcoin being bad for the planet is total bullshit.

A lot of people read a headline about Bitcoin's power consumption, and automatically think it's a waste of power, but the vast majority of those people have never thought about the power consumption of any other industries.

There is a global power problem, which is essentially supply and demand. It's difficult to store and transmit power efficiently over long distances, so lots of power gets wasted. Renewable power is great.

And then regarding game theory, Bitcoin miners can move around and buy the cheapest power available. If the cost of the power goes up, they can move. A city can't move. A country can't move.

I see bitcoin as a ""money battery"", you can convert the power into value, which then could be used instantly anywhere in the world, and you could convert it back into power, or anything else.

Also, renewables are getting more and more efficient every year, so actually Bitcoin mining will probably advance R&amp;D in the renewable energy sector in the future.

Furthermore, bitcoin miners could use heat as a resource. 

I hope people can get over this stupid ""power consumption"" narrative, and I also hope that the media can get over it, because it's becoming clickbait, and a lot of people don't understand how nuanced the topic is. 

I actually think that Bitcoin miners will have a huge positive impact on renewable energy. I'm preaching to the choir here I know, but it just winds me up when I see so many people misunderstanding the argument. Rant over.....

([Source of IMF statement*](https://twitter.com/AFP/status/1486051087736094729?s=20))

&gt; The International Monetary Fund is pushing El Salvador to ditch bitcoin as legal tender, according to a statement released on Tuesday.
&gt; 
&gt; IMF directors “stressed that there are large risks associated with the use of bitcoin on financial stability, financial integrity, and consumer protection, as well as the associated fiscal contingent liabilities.”
&gt; 
&gt; The report, which was published after bilateral talks with El Salvador, went on to “urge” authorities to narrow the scope of its bitcoin law by removing bitcoin’s status as legal money. In September 2021, the Central American nation became the world’s first country to adopt the cryptocurrency as legal tender, alongside the U.S. dollar.
&gt; 
&gt; Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele — who has tethered his political fate to the success of the country’s bitcoin experiment — has added hundreds of bitcoin to the country’s balance sheet in recent months. On Friday, the president tweeted that he bought an additional $15 million of “really cheap” bitcoin.

2022-01-26 10:53:44,"Bitcoin and Metacognition I see Bitcoin as a lossless channel for digital information exchange which is thermodynamically isometric to physical reality. 

This implies that the relative energetic vectors within our nested bioeconomic spheres are now able to commune with the totality of relevant energetic fields despite their lack of spatial proximity. Thus, through decentralized cryptographic communication, Bitcoin overcomes the obstacle of physical communicability of energy. 

This communication process, unfettered neither by human conduction nor the chaos of space, has a bottom-up nature. This bottom-up structural-functional organization ensures that the Bitcoin network does not succumb to the mortality that besets most complex adaptive systems, which had previously self-centralized due to fundamentally constrained memetic parameters. Bitcoin facilitates high fidelity spatio-temporal value exchange across all obstacles due to its meta-dynamic parametric qualities. 

Through this mode of enacted communication, a greater self-understanding of all interconnected energetic systems emerges. Computation of value can now be continuously fed back through this energetic web we call human civilization. Feeding back upon itself in a chaotic fashion, Bitcoin converges upon an equilibrium that is isometric to the interpolated value emergent from universal agentic environmental conformity.

This regression ad infinitum—one unto a pragmatically truthful asymptote—allows for value identification at higher, and more complex, levels of analysis. Reflected in that is a step change for our collective human capacity to enact wisdom across scales.

Bitcoin engenders the convergence of energetic systems.

There are so many things wrong with that comparison, but I’ll point out the two most obvious problems. 

- VISA doesn’t actually settle transaction but merely approve them, promising payment some time in the future. Money doesn’t magically leave my bank account when I swipe my card. Bitcoin actually offers final settlement. That’s a huge difference. 
- Bitcoin provides a layer 1 solution offering unparalleled security and decentralization. Scalability does not happen at this level. It’s like comparing. VISA to bank wire transfers. However, look at the Lightning network which preserves the security and decentralization of the Bitcoin network while providing unprecedented scale. The Lightning network can easily handle hundreds of thousands of transactions per second for (practically) free. VISA charges merchants a 2% fee! Imagine how much money a big company could save if they ditched the card companies and just interested with Lightning instead.

The point is, they try to evaluate bitcoin the same way they do with stocks. So they complain that it has no gains, not cash flow, etc.

This is totally ridiculous and every sensible person should understand that a totally different asset class should be evaluated in different ways, like adoption, network stability, development community, delivered services etc. And (maybe like growth stocks) near future potential.

I'd expect from every financial analyst/advisor that claims to be open and objective to do some research and if they actually do they will realize: Hmm, there is a lot of potential here, there are many risks, there are definitely investment opportunities, DCA for at least a part of one's portfolio could make sense, etc.

Nayib Bukele chose Bitcoin to try to change the future of his country. Under the current system, El Salvador was condemned to survive by begging for aid from the IMF or the World Bank.

Nayib Bukele understood the why of Bitcoin and decided to seize this opportunity to change the future of El Salvador and its people. The people of El Salvador overwhelmingly support Nayib Bukele in what he is trying to do for the country.

El Salvador's bold choice has already changed the way the country is seen around the world. Everyone is talking about El Salvador and more and more entrepreneurs will be coming to El Salvador to participate in this experiment of building the first Bitcoin Nation.

Who knew where El Salvador was before Nayib Bukele made this choice? Very few people. No one was talking about El Salvador. Bitcoin is already a game-changer for El Salvador and this is clearly just the beginning.

While the IMF or the World Bank scoffed at Bitcoin a few years ago, now these institutions are getting scared by the growing possibility that the Bitcoin experiment will succeed in El Salvador and motivate other countries to follow Nayib Bukele's path.

Tonga is talking about adopting Bitcoin by the end of 2022, as are other countries in South and Central America. In short, something is happening and the IMF feels the danger mounting for its obsolete system.

Rather than letting the people determine for themselves, the IMF is threatening El Salvador saying the country must abandon Bitcoin. The IMF's threats only justify, in my opinion, the very existence of Bitcoin and the absolute necessity for the world to have this alternative system available.

Since El Salvador will logically refuse to obey the IMF, what's next? Will America eventually orchestrate a coup in El Salvador to overthrow the government and end the Bitcoin experiment? How far are the powerful people in the current system willing to go to prevent countries from expressing their free will in monetary and financial matters?

El Salvador must continue to resist outside pressure, and other countries that will join the Bitcoin adventure in 2022 must do the same.

2022-01-26 20:19:52,"You Do Not Deserve Bitcoin/Crypto **Introduction: The Opportunities in The Cryptoverse**

Crypto has awakened a revolution in the human realm. Not only it is a place where new wealth is created, it is also where new hopes, visions and ideas emerged within the mission of bettering humanity. Essentially, what crypto brings is the expansion of equal opportunities to all human beings. Through decentralized, permissionless and trustless protocols, crypto offers us a choice and therefore the freedom to decide how we might want to live our life. It is this that makes crypto valuable and at the same time makes the opportunity for wealth here so great.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Reality of Crypto Investing**

Yet in the minds of many, this wealth opportunity is not permanent and should be treated hastily and impulsively. In phases of overt hypes and excitement, people often suffer from the fear of missing out on what they think is their only chance of ever getting rich. But most people didn’t just want to get rich, they wanted to get rich fast. This is when we see people’s appetite for risk increase. They overinvest with money they can not afford to lose, opt-in for riskier assets, borrow capitals they don’t have and begin trading with leverage, all in the hope of “making it” in the shortest period as possible.

This exuberance of impatience is what causes much of the irrationality seen in this market, We view crypto no more than ups or downs, green days or red days. We measure the success of a project based on the gains and losses instead of any real progress or concrete fundamentals. We became narrow-minded with our black and white perspectives on the space as a whole. We scream just as loud when the market goes up as it is when going down. We create unrealistic expectations in euphoric moments only to spread unnecessary fears when we enter dispair. We become the victims of our emotions, and not only does it hurt our ability to invest safely and soundly, it also hurts the credibility and the authenticity of the cryptoverse.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Culture of Crypto**

A big reason for what we are observing is the results of the culture we created in crypto. There is an extreme obsession with price in this space. It is said to be what facilitates adoption and awareness yet the reality is the large majority of price-inducing attention and interest are cheap and valueless. Some might say it is a reflection of growth and progression but this is a misconception. In crypto, fundamentals do not dictate prices. It may justify it, however, it is mainly market sentiments that drive prices, to levels that no one could ever expect or imagine, both to the upside and the downside.

The current culture of crypto does not concern with genuine adoption and things such as network effect. The game everybody is playing is predicting and speculating on how high or how low or how long, or how short these periods of hypes and pains are. The focus is on loading up bags at the very bottom and dumping them at the very top. For most individuals, this is how you win the crypto game, and it is this mentality that causes the mass to views crypto no more than a casino, a zero-sum game, and to utter things such as “decentralization does not matter”.

These are the perspectives oversaturated in the space today. People who hold these narrowed mindsets speaks no different than corrupted politicians and acts no different than the banks and corporations we wish to detach from the old system. They see themselves as the center of the cryptoverse and judge the success of the space based on how much it can profit them. These are the same people who would never try to understand crypto or do not believe in what it stands for and subsequently, they are the one who would intoxicate this space with nonsense and hopiums that benefits nobody but themselves.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Harsh Truth For Crypto Investors**

The honest truth is the majority of us do not deserve to be in crypto. Most of us are here to take from this space rather than giving. Most of us are here to consume instead of to create. Most of us are here for the hypes, to then turn cold when tough times come by. The matter of fact is we never value the things that are being built and are being given in this space. We never wanted the freedom in finding opportunities and in building wealth. All we wanted is the securities, the guarantee to get rich. All we wanted is to be told what to invest and how to invest. All we wanted is the magic pill that makes us successful without ever failings.

The majority of us don’t even want real innovation, we want more memecoins, more ponzinomics and more forked yield farms. We want easy money without taking much risk, and often when things don’t go our way, we don’t even take responsibility for our actions. There is always something or someone to blame, and if we can not resolve our frustration and failures, we turn against the space with hatred and bitterness to the leaders, to the communities, and to the future of crypto itself.

This is the reality of most market participants in the cryptoverse, especially during market downturns, where all eyes are fixated on the same number that is influenced by the least reliable and least rational factor called human emotions. Those who fail are those who often subject themselves to emotional thinking influenced by the mass. In contrast, those who succeed are those who can detach themselves from the irrationality of the market, and more importantly, the irrationality of they themselves. Yet it is easier said than done when you are a human, who is ingrained with fears and desires. So how do you “make it” here?

&amp;#x200B;

**Finding Success in Crypto**

By directing your focus on the objective reality, the progression, the bigger picture; by learning, exploring, involving and developing a deep conviction in something; by trusting the process, trusting the visions and trusting the leadership of those who wish to bring the best to the future of humanity. How you succeed in crypto is dependent entirely on you and your capacity to remains here for a long period of time, through both sunshine and rainy days, good and tough times. How you win here is a matter of how you look towards the future of crypto and what it can bring to all of us.

Without a reason to hold on to your investment, you will deem to lose hope and fail. Without a strong belief, you will become just another victim of the dishonest and the deceitful in this market. Diving deep into the world of crypto, you will find there is so much noise here. You will be drowned in the sea of human emotions, ready to engulf you in projection and expectations that are meant to impel you into bad decisions. But it isn’t your job to change the culture that exists in crypto. It is your responsibility to filter out the noise here and be in charge of your investment and your own financial future.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR; Conclusion**

There is a saying “ you don’t deserve 500% gains if you can’t handle 50% lost in crypto”, likewise, you do not deserve the success in crypto if you can’t build yourself up to handle the nature of this market. Understand that crypto is no heaven. It is not a place to save you from the misery of your own reality, nor it was never meant to satisfy your thirst for wealth. Crypto was made for humanity and for the collective. Perhaps with this realization, you will find a grip of where you stand in this space, and by adjusting your mindset and your investment thesis, you will ultimately come out on top as someone who is brave enough to take risks, while patient enough to reap the rewards.

2022-01-27 01:27:10,"True story about banks. Made me cry out for Bitcoin so softly... Closed on a house yesterday, I'm the seller.  Got a few houses (small landlord here), and have both bought and sold real estate over the years, so this wasn't my first rodeo.  But it was my first time to sell a house and have this much frustration getting my funds for available use.  So I signed all the paperwork at the Title Company, and they gave me my check, and I didn't really look at the check all that hard, and it turns out it was not a cashier's check but a normal, regular 3rd party check.  So I took the check to my bank (Wells Fargo), and the cashier tells me it will take 2 days for it to be made available.  Two days!  

The buyer gets to go into my house the moment I signed the final paperwork and gave him the keys.  But...I have to wait 2 full stinkin days to get to use my funds???  The cashier said ""Well, the first $400 will actually be available now, but the remainder customarily takes 2 days.  That's our policy.""  Wow, well, nice of them to let me use $400 right off the bat, huh?  I explained to her that it's a closing check from a title company, she said no matter, all checks are handled this way.  I asked her what my options are to get the funds available immediately, she said go get cash itself, or a cashier's check. 

So I went to the bank the check was drawn on (Hancock Bank), and asked to cash it.  They said they don't have that much cash on hand (it was $120k, the check), I'd have to drive to their main branch which was a 40 minute drive.  I said ok, and drove it.  The cashier there called the issuer of the check, the Title Company owner, but it kept going to his voicemail.  She said she couldn't cash it until she confirmed with him.  So I called his office, apparently he had gone to lunch and his secretary couldn't get a hold of him.  I waited at the bank about 40 minutes and never got a hold of him, so I gave up and headed back toward my bank.  I decided to stop at his office and give it one more chance of finding him to ask for a cashier's check, but his office was closed and locked now!  Apparently he was not coming back from lunch and the secretary had left and locked things up (yeah, the most unprofessional thing I've seen in a long time).  So now it was getting later into the afternoon and I went back to my bank and just deposited the stupid check.  I couldn't get a hold of the guy, and didn't want to push it off to the next day and it end up being 3 days before I could even use my funds.  

I went home.  Before long the guy calls me back finally, I tell him the whole story, he's apologizing up and down, I said don't worry about it but can we fix it.  He said yeah, meet me at Wells Fargo in half an hour (right before they closed).  We met there, he brought a cashier's check this time and said he put a stop payment on the original check (which was pending in my account).  So, the lady at Wells Fargo explained that the stop payment would cause the first check to bounce eventually, and the funds would come back out along with a fee of $12.  I said ok, whatever, sure I'll pay 12 bucks, just let's get me my funds available.  So I deposited the cashier's check, and then found out it would take until midnight that night!!! 

So all that work and driving and waiting and a $12 fee, to get my funds literally 18 hours earlier.  I can't express my level of frustration at the whole thing.  Past closings have always been paid by wire transfer, which while it wouldn't hit my account until like 2-3 hours after I'd signed the paperwork and turned the keys over, at least I got use of the funds that same day.  This was a MISERABLE EXPERIENCE!!!!  I will never allow a Title Company to give me anything but an IMMEDIATE wire transfer, going forward.  Ever.  Or Bitcoin.  

The entire time I kept thinking ""Bitcoin solves this....Bitcoin solves ALL of this....OMG Bitcoin....""",-0.999972939491272,0.1065396185355863,0.3959859584859584,0.073,0.052,0.875,0.958

This mindset shift of the orange pilled life has really struck a chord where the cat is out and not going back in. When I first held btc and it pumped, I Immediately thought of the fiat value, what new things I could buy with my gains, and cashed some out. Now I see things priced in BTC and selling my investments in my early twenties is a cardinal sin and will allocate future income in discretionary ways, opposed to spending the capital I have now.

Doing accounting in BTC terms strikes me as a huge shift in thinking, recognition that the gold standard and hard money doesn't discourage spending, but discourages wasteful spending and incentivizes getting real return out of money spent.

Inflationary environments have complex mechanisms that obfuscate costs. The consumer is placated by CPI (cheap pizza and youtube) while assets continue to not be held for no real reason other than a lack of education and exploitation of the fact by capital owners; who can afford to do things like war to control supply chains, while the wage slaves drive the boats and work the fields for an ever decreasing nominal income.

A couple things have become quite clear. The fed will likely never be audited and the debt cycle they've created will lead to a revolution.

2022-01-27 08:14:01,"I flew to El Salvador’s Bitcoin Beach for 4 days… here’s what I learned… I went to El Salvador with no expectations. When I first landed it felt hot, lovely. Had to wait for a friend so I grabbed the rental car, where they try and scam you for insurance, and went for a coffee. Friend arrived and we drove to El Zonte a.k.a Bitcoin Beach.

The drive we thought we were going to be shot, not sure why but you hear stories. We didn’t get shot. Checked in the Airbnb no probs, no hot water though.

Next day we drive to the beach for coffee and bump straight into Max Keiser and Stacy Herbert, said hi, Stacy was nice but Max was not interested, I probably wouldn’t be to be fair, especially when I’m after a coffee.

Bitcoin signs everywhere, talked to a bunch of people and some knew about bitcoin but mostly not, felt like just a lot of travellers there passing through. I think all the stuff you see online you assume everyone is walking around with Chivo wallets but it doesn’t seem to be the case, maybe other places it’s like that but not here.

We contacted some estate/realtor agents and saw two properties just to see what’s available, this place literally has nothing, when I say nothing I mean you’ll need to put water in, electricity, it’s so behind the times that most people here live in tin shacks by the road/river. It seems that there’s chancers there trying their luck to get bitcoiners to buy shacks but there really isn’t any point… the reality is you can’t either, not straight forward anyway as you’ll need a lawyer and even if you buy something you’re not 100% sure you own it, it’s confusing, plus the government has some rule where they can take property off people.

My thoughts are this won’t be the future of Bitcoin, it’s so behind the times. The people were lovely, beautiful scenery, great weather but realistically this place will take 20 years to develop and in the next couple of years there will most likely be other countries adopting Bitcoin, countries which are already developed.

El Salvador is definitely cool and will probably the Mecca/pilgrimage place for the future of where it all started to be accepted but I can’t see it being anything but that. I actually hope I’m wrong because it was first and deserves so much more but after visiting and seeing how undeveloped it is I’d be very surprised if people actually go there.

If anyone has been to San Salvador and people are daily using their Chivo wallets then please comment, I hope there is more use of it as I read millions of people have them but whether they’re active accounts would be interesting to know.

The last thing I want to say is this trip has made me realise how truly early we are still… one place is using Bitcoin and it’s underdeveloped. I can’t imagine what Bitcoin will be like when everyone is using it… it blows my mind! It’s so early.",-0.999895453453064,0.14365688131313128,0.5312210648148149,0.134,0.042,0.824,0.9954

2022-01-27 16:32:06,"Scams, Bitcoin, and the perception of Crypto Right now there is an exceptional amount of negative sentiment toward (in ranking order of negativity) NFTs, Crypto as a whole, and Bitcoin. What is important to understand is for the vast majority of people there is not difference between the 3. It is all crypto, and it is all bad for one reason or another.

The most valuable thing anyone who believes in Bitcoin can do is show people who currently don't why they should. You could say there is a selfish motive, and cleary there is a benefit to a hodler by convincing someone else to buy in, but there is equally an altruistic motive. You want other people to partake in the revolution. You want them to be an early (yes it is still early) benefactor of of the technology which will free us from the tyranny of central authority's manipulation and theft of our life energy.

So, what I think is is prudent in these times is to understand that when someone says ""crypto is a scam"", it is not a time to argue. They are right in some capacity. There have been so many scams, so much unbridled greed, so much manipulation and rug pulls in the market. Millions of people have been left holding the bag on so many projects. Unfortunately, that negative sentiment generated from the shitcoin market (and I don't believe all other coins are shit but probably 95% + are) is blanketing bitcoin.

Instead of arguing, it's an opportunity to show empathy and guide them toward the real solution to the problem, which is Bitcoin. More deeply, it's about helping people realize the point of investing isn't to purely chase gains. The point is to put your money toward things you believe in, and there is nothing more compelling than to believe in than Bitcoin if you have a respect for liberty and the sovereignty of the individual.",-0.9980776309967041,0.11183473389355744,0.5261204481792717,0.11,0.145,0.745,-0.9507

Just a thought I had this morning while reading some news. 

With the Ukraine situation, US and EU are setting up some sanctions towards Russia, Putin and Russian politicians. 

Those sanctions are mainly targeting :

* The trade of assets [owned Russian politicians](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20211217-eu-leaders-agree-to-impose-new-sanctions-on-russia-if-it-invades-ukraine),
* The [trade of natural resources](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-60134295), making most of Russia's GDP,
* The ability of Russian banks to use the SWIFT network (info in the first link also) to settle international trades.

Moreover, trades of natural resources and the SWIFT network use mainly the US dollar has the mean to transact.

With these informations, and the fact that coming from nowhere, Putin is speaking about Russia to start mining Bitcoin and no longer ban cryptocurrencies, I think that *maybe* there is a chance that he wants to use the Bitcoin network and bitcoin to trade natural resources.

\--

I’m not going to say I was drunk. But let’s just say I was feeling chatty when I met Luis Alejandro Rodriguez-Sanchez in the checkout aisle of the Megasuper in a small town in Southern Costa Rica. It was the large Bitcoin sticker on the back of his phone that caught my attention. I’d been curious about Bitcoin adoption in this small Latin American country, and most especially in this small, remote and poor coastal town near the border with Panama.

I asked the young Costa Rican man in Spanish if he invests in Bitcoin. He said yes and gave me a knowing smile. I replied with an even more broad smile because I was *almost* drunk, which he seemed to appreciate because he laughed, gave me a dap and we started to chat.

I was immediately fascinated with this young man because he represented an answer to a question I’d been asking myself for quite a while. The question is this: “Now that the internet allows us to invent and participate in the future from anywhere, are people in these remote towns in developing nations getting involved?”.....",0.9995768666267395,0.03195812807881773,0.3953817733990147,0.123,0.031,0.845,0.9748

2022-01-28 06:46:02,"MythBuster - ""Should I start Bitcoin mining?"" Dear Gents!

As I receive the same questions multiple times a week and most people compare apples to oranges when it comes to mining BTC I want to clear out some misinformation. 

&amp;#x200B;

* **I need very low kw/h energy price to start mining!**

WRONG - Most of the mining calculators show your mining profit in USD, which is **very** misleading!

Low kw/h helps you to keep your running costs down but has nothing to do with the profit you mine. You could even mine at a ""loss"" as of now but as long as you dont have to sell your BTC to cover your electricity costs you can sell your BTC far in the future. 

&amp;#x200B;

* **What is my ROI (return of investment)?**

A Bitmain S19Pro (110 th/s) at Compass Mining (hosted at one of their facilities) costs approx. USD 11.000,- (was USD 13.800,- just a few weeks ago). As you won’t be mining USD you should calculate everything, except the running costs, in BTC. That means the S19Pro will cost you BTC 0,30; your daily mining profit is approx. BTC 0,00048; that means it would take you 625 days (1,7 years) until you break even. **BUT** as soon as you adjust your mining profit with a conservative monthly 5% difficult adjustment it will take you more than 5 years to break even!

I am pretty sure that a S19Pro wont survive for 5+ years but after 1-2 years you might still have a working ASIC and sell it second-hand. ASIC miners are getting exponentially more powerful by the year so the question remains how much BTC you will receive for a second hand “old-school” S19Pro. If it is less than 0,21 BTC you will lose.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Will BTC difficult adjustment continue “uponly”?**

Yes, very likely. The demand for ASICs is huge and I don’t even want to get into the topic of countries starting mining with running electricity cost of zero or big companies a la IBM getting into SHA256 ASIC production.

&amp;#x200B;

* **I want to diversify my portfolio and start mining.**

Mate, you are not diversifying your portfolio by selling BTC for ASICs that mine BTC. You only hope to get more BTC through mining in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

* **How much should a Bitmain S19Pro cost to make a good ROI?**

Assuming a monthly 5% difficult adjustment you will mine approx. BTC 0,14 in the first year and BTC 0,076 in your second year. In my opinion it would be good to break even after 2 years which gives you a ASIC price of USD 8.000,-.

As for simplicity I didn’t include the running costs as it will most likely be paid in FIAT. You could even calculate your electricity costs and assume you buy BTC with it on a monthly basis…. That makes your ROI of the miner even worse.

Cheers,

Arnhodl",-0.9996398687362671,0.10006775067750678,0.4884417344173441,0.117,0.058,0.824,0.9869

I've been very bullish for a few years now but as always when doing my research, I try to find holes in theories so that I can invalidate any counter arguments.

One thing that seems slightly overlooked to me in TBS is innovation.

The author writes about how Bitcoin discourages wasteful production in the sense that companies will only invest capital in things that are actually useful. We will see less wasteful products/services produced as companies will only part with their BTC capital for a overall net sum profit. I understand this to be because of the finite amount of Bitcoin available and throwing capital around willy nilly will make it difficult to get that bitcoin back.

This stuck with me because its long been known that many technological innovations have come from R&amp;D completely unrelated to the innovative finding. For example, space or military tech often finds ways to be useful in everyday life that no one would have expected.

Could this be a concern in that if we dont throw capital around like we do now, we might slow down innovation.

2022-01-28 17:38:47,"Goldman: Bitcoin, Altcoins to Become More Correlated With Traditional Financial-Market Variables  

The recent pullback in the cryptocurrency market shows that mainstream adoption can be a “double-edged sword,” Goldman Sachs said in a report Thursday.

Since November, the bank notes, the total crypto market cap has fallen around 40%. The slide is unique in that it was driven mainly by macroeconomic factors, that is developments that were outside digital markets, it said.

Mainstream adoption can raise valuations but at the same time will also likely raise correlations with other financial market variables, which reduces the diversification benefits of holding digital assets, analysts led by Zach Pandl wrote in the note.

The decline in bitcoin was highly correlated to the “drawdown in low-profitability tech stocks and recent IPOs,” which reacted negatively to the Federal Reserve’s move toward interest-rate increases, the report said.

Bitcoin is at the center of recent rotations across asset classes, Goldman said, as it is positively correlated with proxies for inflation risk and frontier technology equity sectors, and is negatively correlated with real interest rates and the value of the U.S. dollar.

Sharp falls in token prices resulted in liquidations and a decline in borrowing on decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms – which use coins as collateral – much like in the traditional financial system, the bank noted.

Further development of blockchain technology, such as metaverse applications, may provide a “secular tailwind” for certain digital assets over time, but they won’t be “immune to macroeconomic forces,” such as monetary tightening by central banks, the report said.",-0.9935609102249146,0.03526532607177768,0.38516827258762737,0.102,0.016,0.882,0.9749

Please don’t tell me to just “google it”; that doesn’t add anything positive to the conversation…

Now pardon me if some of these questions appear to be novice, but here goes:

1. What is the true utility or appeal of using a cryptocurrency versus any other currency? What advantage does it offer that we can not get from other methods? 

2. With prices fluctuating and being volatile, how does the value of a “currency” become usable as… a currency?

3. Without bitcoin/wallets being insured/backed by any organization? How can investors/adopters be confident in utilizing this currency without the potential for losses? (e.g. brokerage accounts/banks being backed by FDIC)

4. Is energy consumption/usage related to bitcoin mining/usage truly a long-term issue?

5. Can there be any updates to bitcoin in the future to change how it is used/simplicity, new “features”, etc. If so, who controls this?

6. If we don’t truly know who created Bitcoin, how can we be so sure in it’s existence long-term, nothing will be edited in a malicious way, and it won’t just vanish?

These questions are meant to clear up potential misunderstandings or skepticisms regarding bitcoin/cryptocurrencies. If you truly believe in the utility and future of bitcoin then you should also want these questions to be clearly answered so others could comfortably invest and be educated on the matter imo.

Many bitcoin owners don't seem to be aware of the huge surge in ""Wrapped"" BTC in recent months which also coincided with the crash. While real BTC on exchanges is reaching lows, **Alameda Research** is flooding exchanges with ""Wrapped Bitcoin"" at a growing rate to artificially dilute supply. This is contributing to the price suppression in recent months despite the supply decline:

Look at the dates where they move their WBTC to exchanges then look at the charts.

WBTC is claimed to be mainly for ""defi"" on ethereum and other platforms, but if that was the case, why are they being moved straight to centralized exchanges (specialls FTX and Huobi) right after their minting?

And of course, while they claim WBTC is backed 1:1 with real bitcoin, we have no way of knowing if the real bitcoin in custody isn't also being lent.

(or worse, down to around zero)

  
Interestingly, you don't need much money to bet on **derivative** markets, so I am curious to how much money they would actually need.

The derivative market would drive down the spot market, thanks to arbitrage traders.

  
The Central Bank would, of course, never feel the need to ""take profit"" and get out of the positions, because they are not doing it for the money but instead are doing it to destroy decentralised crypto. So they would keep their position forever (rolling to the next future expiry every-time or whatever).

Bitcoin is the world's first ideal speculative asset we could actually lower the price of all the basic human needs just by properly putting excess Capital into this vehicle.. (food housing transportation work everything can be reduced to affordability)

Bitcoin is also the world's first ideal collateral! Do you want to get the best interest rate, at some point all you have to do is stake Bitcoin.

Everybody could use Bitcoin for a number of reasons not only because of its value but because it is also a global Ledger of agreement. Not only do we want agreements on value and who controls that value (Bitcoin) but we also want an agreement on title and important documents...

Bitcoin is the only Idael Reserve Asset countries can use to back their own currency.... you want to know if they have the money to print all their currency, just check their wallet.

Bitcoin's also the Idael treasury asset as you're going to witness with microstrategy.

Also a global Ledger of agreement is what you need to replace all of 20th century brick-and-mortar banking systems and in that way pave the way for the 21st century financial future.

But Bitcoin is also an Ideal network, from which to Anchor all second layer and third layer as well as side chain projects. ( Bitcoin is what Ethereum can never be, and Bitcoin can be all that ETH is and more) I called this my #BitcoinHydraThesis all possible blockchain Innovation is going to be built on top of the most decentralized and most secure network... is this world second best isn't good enough. Why would I put a billion dollars in the second best network?

Then there's the humbling fact that Bitcoin likely represents far more than we can imagine today just like the internet of 1982 could not have imagined the internet of today.

2022-01-30 02:17:02,"I'm a bank teller at a large North American Bank, and every day I'm reminded how much we need Bitcoin. As someone who works for a bank in a customer-facing retail setting I'm one of the first people they come to when they have banking issues they need help with, or complaints with our policies.


These issues/complaints include any and all of the following:


- Credit/debit card fraud in which their card is being used without their permission.

- Card fraud in which their card/personal details where stolen either through phishing or a similar scam.

- Cards being locked due to ""suspicious transactions""(which might not even be suspicious in many cases which just frustrates people)

- Checks being put on hold for anywhere between 1-6 business days, or even up to 10 for big checks.

- Accounts being partially frozen or even closed due to potential 
fraud activity.

- Payment apps like Zelle either not letting people link their accounts, or blocking payments due to lack of similar payment activity or whatever they deem ""suspicious activity""

- Customer cannot easily transfer funds from their old bank to ours because the other bank has no local branches

- Customers wanting large withdrawals, but don't we don't have enough cash on hand to give it all to one customer

- National coin shortage causing frustration for business customers

- Wire transfer fees/processing time

- Maintenance fees

- Overdraft fees

- Bank check/money order fees

- Non-customer fees

- Non-customer ATM fees

- ""Non-transactional account"" transfer fees

- Pending transactions taking days to post

- Real companies making charges on people's cards when they haven't even been there in months

- People complaining the ATM doesn't work after they just stuffed dozens of shitty dirty bills and water stained checks in it

- A couple deposited all their money via bank check from their old bank and it was put on hold for over a week leaving them with no money.

- Woman wanted to wire $100 to her family but was turned away because Intl wires cost $50 off the top and may or may not have fees on the receiving bank as well.

- Guy couldn't access his money from his old bank across the country which required him to physically be there to initiate a wire.

- Guy lost a fairly large bank check in the parking lot a few plazas over and took weeks to get in contact with him to put a stop on it.

- Checks/cards not showing up in the mail, wasting people's time to have to come in and reorder and put stops on the lost items.

- Old people who literally pay money to buy checks only to drive to the bank, stand in line, and write themselves a check for $100 cash  and ask for a balance - only to repeat this every other day.

----------
The fact that these problems and inconveniences even exist is a problem in itself. Bitcoin fixes all of these because they are completely irrelevant on a Bitcoin system. In economics 101 they teach you that the definition of an efficient market is one where **all information is transmitted perfectly, completely, instantly, and for no cost**. Bitcoin dramatically increases efficiency in banking and will inevitably become the standard medium of storing money/value.

**Food for thought:** Customers will often ask for their pay checks to deposited as cash. If we can tell the check is legit or if we're familiar with the person(kyc) we'll deposit it as cash even though the check is from another institution, meaning in reality the receiving bank isn't getting anything besides a piece of paper and a promise that the account on the check is good for the funds. Verifying those funds takes a business day or more, but meanwhile the funds get poofed into the persons account at the click of a button. Also as many of you know, since March 2020, deposit institutions are now required to keep 0% of their total deposit accounts in cash reserves. Zero percent! 

So that's why when I hear someone say that Bitcoin isn't ""backed"" by anything, my question is what the hell is a dollar backed by besides dirty green rectangles with some old guy's signature?",-0.9999728202819824,0.05280423280423279,0.43082010582010577,0.045,0.108,0.848,-0.9909
2022-01-30 02:23:51,"Bitcoin Standard vs. Fiat Standard Upon spending countless hours on the subject matter, I have come to the conclusion that Bitcoin is way superior as a sustainable financial base layer. However, the Fiat Standard has been in place for 50 years since the official abandonment of the Gold Standard in 1971, it will take an insane amount of effort to displace it. 

An analogy to the current situation would be the QWERTY keyboard; just look at the layout layout… it makes no sense! The keys are arranged in such a way to slow down typing on purpose (to avoid mechanical jamming in the typewriter era). But it’s a protocol that stuck and people are used to it. Second layer functions have been built on it; control-x/c/v done with the left hand so that the right hand can stay with the mouse. If you change the QWERTY layout to a more efficient format, these second layer functions will instantly become obsolete. 

Same goes for the Fiat Standard. So much stuff and second layer functions have been built on it. And a lot of people are benefiting from this existing infrastructure which is predominantly US dollar based. From what I can see, Bitcoin’s biggest challenge is the purposeful resistance from the Fiat Standard and its army of second/third layer networks. 

I think soon, certain nation states will start converting (maybe partially to begin with) their USD from trade surplus to Bitcoin rather than buying US Treasury. Would you rather have your local currency backed by an ever inflating Fiat coupon, or the hardest asset ever known to mankind? The choice is clear as day.

Is not the solution for your admirable ability to burn your financial life again in your next great idea to get billionaire! You are responsible for not being wealthy yet because you are not ready to be. Don't give up and keep learning everyday, not day dreaming and becoming more depressed.

Bitcoin is not an investment, bitcoin is much more, is freedom!!! I buy bitcoin in USD and spend in any currency  around the world not worrie of the BTC price against USD. I make my BtC grow up in any currency, anytime, anywhere. Find your own reason to hold crypto. If your admirable brillhant mind thinks  pay back 12% of your disgraceful anual income in taxes to live and keep living in a great society is too much, fine! Use bitcoin to reduce that! That's power! Everyone can do the same!

Find yourself how Bitcoin can be useful in your lifestyle. If you can't answer this question, don't ever buy bitcoin!
I never bought any other cryptocurrency because for me there's no point. Don't let anyone illusions intervene your path. 

Give yourself a chance to find a better use and make your decisions based on yourself.
Close your useless crypto positions and enjoy your life.

While you are reading my message, I am probably having a drink with my lovely wife and I hope you do the same!

My best wishes for you guys!!",0.9988282322883606,0.2908149576118327,0.5410714285714286,0.198,0.064,0.738,0.9967

By Katy Perry

I won't just survive  
Oh, you will see me thrive  
Can't write my story  
I'm beyond the archetype  
I won't just conform  
No matter how you shake my core  
'Cause my roots, they run deep, oh

Oh, ye of so little faith  
Don't doubt it, don't doubt it  
Victory is in my veins  
I know it, I know it  
And I will not negotiate  
I'll fight it, I'll fight it  
I will transform

When, when the fire's at my feet again  
And the vultures all start circling  
They're whispering, you're out of time  
But still, I rise  
This is no mistake, no accident  
When you think the final nail is in, think again  
Don't be surprised, I will still rise

They sayOh, ye of so little faith  
Don't doubt it, don't doubt it  
Victory is in your veins  
You know it, you know it  
And you will not negotiate  
Just fight it, just fight it  
And be transformed'

The wallet itself was made by this coin cloud mobile app, which I still have access to.  I had put 200 dollars in just to try it out and get the signup reward.  So it's not a life changing amount of money but it's still annoying.

I can't turn off the option to require the encrypt key without having the encrypt key, and coin cloud support says they can't turn that option off for me.  And I assume there's no way to get the wallet onto a different platform without the seed phrase.

I can attempt to guess my encrypt key as many times as i want, but it was made with bit warden defaults, so 14 characters long all special characters/numbers/letters possible.  So of course i can't just manually try to guess it.

Is there any possibility of getting this 200 in BTC off this wallet or is it just lost now?

It not only affect nocoiners, but also people that have been in Bitcoin for a long time when the person is not able to identify with the current narratives of the Bitcoin community.

The /r/btc movement is a good example of this. When it became obvious that Bitcoin wasn't able to scale on chain for payments to the whole world, a big portion of early Bitcoiners was not able to accept this and became deranged in conspiracy theories instead.

Another common cause is being a Bitcoin OG that sold too soon, just before the big run-up and now claim to have lost belief in Bitcoin. Now they instead start dabble in altcoins.

2022-01-30 20:38:48,"Why the Lightning Network is the most important thing in Bitcoin right now.  Here are five reasons for the title´s claim, ordered from most the significant to the least.

**1.** **Increases decentralization**

To run a Lightning Node, you have to also be running a fully synced Bitcoin Core node. This simple technical requirement means that the number of full Bitcoin nodes is going to explode. Bitcoin  nodes are the most important part of the network since they enforce the consensus rules. Therefore, the more nodes, the better level of the decentralization and the more immune the Bitcoin Network will be to consensus rules change as we saw during the Blocksize war. For example, if someone wanted to change our beloved 21 million fixed supply, they would have to convince a substantial majority of people. The more nodes and the more spread out they are across the globe, the more impossible this tasks becomes.  
However, I've always felt that the incentives for an individual running a Bitcoin Node were never that strong. It was always sold as “*having full sovereignty over your transactions by not needing to be trust any third party*.” But this is only going to convince a small group of people. A second argument that does have a bit more reach is the altruistic argument, “*you should run a bitcoin node to help out the network*.” Many hardcore bitcoiners probably run their nodes for this reason, but it is not a sustainable value proposition for the long term and won´t allow us to reach the insanely high level of decentralization mandated by a global trustless currency.  
However, I believe the incentives for running a Lightning Node, which implies running a Bitcoin Node under the hood, are far far stronger. First of all, if you are an individual or medium to large business that is going to be making and/or receiving a lot of transactions, you can use your own lightning node to make sure you'll always be playing lowest possible fees. As a merchant with your own node, you can make sure your customers will pay the minimum fees for buying one of your products or if you are paying suppliers you can ensure that your node will search for the shortest route and minimize your fees paid. You can of course use a free custodial third party that avoids the hassle of installing your own lightning node but you will end up paying higher fees over the long run, that's how they make their money of course. So a very simple and selfish incentive emerges: people will run lightning nodes so that they can save money. A time tried incentive that is pretty effective. 

But an even stronger incentive than saving money is making money. Many people already run what are called routing nodes, with the only purpose of routing payments and taking a small fee every time. This is in fact the main reason why people are interested in running a Lightning node in order to generate a small secondary income stream. 

Finally, the third selfish incentive is that for some sad nerdy people, like myself, running a node actually is fun! There is a growing group of hobbyists that enjoy maintaining their nodes and participating in the network as a whole, just check out [PlebNet ](https://plebnet.wiki/wiki/Welcome_to_Plebnet)for proof of this. Unlike running a simple Bitcoin node where you simply get up and running and then just watch it sit there, running a Lightning Network involves active maintanance by rebalancing channels or figuring which nodes to connect to. This community involvement effect as definitely been a driver for adoption.

These three incentives are much stronger than anything preceding them, and it simply means that many more people will want to run a Lightning note and therefore as a by-product they will also be running a Bitcoin node, whether they want to or not and whether they even know it or not. The end result is a far more decentralized network which will take Bitcoin´s most valuable attribute, decentralization, to a whole new level.

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Solves the privacy tradeoff**

The criticism that both Edward Snowden and Eric Weinstein have made of Bitcoin, which is for me the only reasonable criticism of the protocol, is its lack of privacy on the base layer. The issue is that there needs to be a public record for every transaction as a by-product of having a decentralized blockchain. Buying Bitcoin without KYC is becoming increasingly a legal grey area, and the ability for people to track transactions threatens one of Bitcoin's most important features: ***fungibility***. If certain coins have a shady history, they might be worth less, while freshly mined coins can be sold at a premium. This is not good.

But the Lightning Network comes to the rescue.  When you open a Lightning channel, you are sending funds to a 2 of 2 multisig address and from there they do not move, **ever**, until the channel is closed. Now with taproot, people won´t even be able to see that it´s a multisig, so they won´t even know that´s it problaby a channel opening transaction.  


You transact on the Lightning network by exchanging and updating IOUs with your channel peer, as many times as required. This is 100% private, these transactions are fully within your custody and nobody can ever know how or what you spent your money on. Even nodes re-routing payments cannot know the sender and the receiver. 

The Lightning Network does not increase the privacy of payment, it makes payments **100% private**. **Absolutely and unequivocally private**. End of.

This is an insane innovation when you think about it, not only are payments still permissionless and uncensorable, they are now also uncompromisingly private, no longer suffering from the trade-off of transacting on a public ledger like the base Bitcoin layer does.

And my favourite part of this is that when you take your funds back onto the Bitcoin network, their traceability have also almost been entirely eliminated. Imagine that you buy 1m Satoshis from a fully KYC´ed exchange and then move your Sats from the exchange to your wallet and then from there you open a Lightning channel with a well-connected node in order to spend your Bitcoin. Let's say you go on a bit of a shopping spree and you end up spending around 800K Satoshis. You decide that it would be wiser to save your remaining 200,000 sats by sending to your cold storage, so you close your lightning channel, which means you move that amount from the multisig address to your cold wallet address. If you use a fresh address (which wallets will almost always generate automatically even if you are sending back to the same wallet), then there is absolutely no way on-chain analysis can know which UXTO is yours and which belongs to the other channel peer. They will see two transactions on the Blockchain with no idea which belongs to who. And funnily enough, if you spent the entire amount you put in to channel, when closing it there would only be one transaction on the blockchain and again nobody will know if those Sats are going back to you in or to the owner of the node,  and so nobody knows if you spent the entirety o none of your coins. ***What in essence you have done is an ad hoc CoinJoin which severs the relationship between your KYC account and your Bitcoin***. (As along as you do not use the same address as you opened the channel with, it goes without saying).

Even if the chain analysis makes the assumption that you spent all your Bitcoin,it is impossible for them to know what you spent it on and where those Satoshis now are.  


 Privacy solved.

**3.  Makes every altcoin irrelevant**

One way of understanding s\*\*\* coins  is to think of them as being a counterfeit copy of the Bitcoin protocole and token, pretending to offer a better or more specialized version of it when in reality it only dillute the value of Bitcoin´s market cap and serves as a very pesky distraction for many newcomers. This is an unfortunate consequence of Bitcoin´s open source nature, and the threat posed by s\*\*\* coins in the short to medium term is far larger than what many think many contemplate. 

However, the traction already garnered by the Lightning network and it's capabilities really do put the shame all other coins that supposedly are solving Bitcoins scalability limitations. Many s\*\*\* coins sacrifice decentralization for more transactional efficiency. Meanwhile, the Lightning network achieves the highest speed of transaction at a ridiculously low costs without sacrificing in any shape or form the decentralized and secure properties of the underlying Bitcoin network. This makes other sh\*\*coins completely irrelevant. And the number of users between both is an undeniable proof of this. **Millions** of people use the Lightning network to make transactions **everyday**. **And when I say millions I am not exaggerating**. No other s\*\*\* coin even comes close to this number. 

Another subset of sh\*\* coins claim to use blockchain technologies for non-monetary use cases such as messaging or logistics or art. The whole Web 3.0 blurb. However, every single one of these ideas can be built far more easily on the Lightning network, and they already are. They are known as LAPPS. These are considered as layer 3 solutions and tackle specific problems. Of course many of these will fail just like in any free market but at least they won´t be stealing people's money when doing so, since investing in these solutions will go through the traditional private market. There is no publicly available token for people to be swindled into buying. 

Sphinx and Zion are a great example of this. Again I'm not saying that these are going to be successful, but they are proof that we do not need to be creating completely new chains and pouring capital into them in order to try use cases that by definition are aimed at a small niche of users. I really hope the Lightning Network exposes the Altcoin ecosystem for the inefficient capital draining and overhyped speculation that it really is. Smart entrepreneurs will soon understand that it is far cheaper and efficient to build and fail and iterate on the Lightning network. And in the long term, only smart entrepreneurs win. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**4. Offers a Proof-of-Stake Alternative**

This rarely gets mentioned, but it's simple enough to understand. Imagine you could lock up your Bitcoin and get rewarded on a percentage basis for processing transactions. Sounds very much like proof of stake, right?

Well, the Lightning network offers you that option. Nodes can charge a small transaction fee for routing payments between unconnected nodes. This means you get a small financial reward for providing the liquidity the network needs. This offers pretty clear competition to what Ethereum is trying so hard and yet failing so far to implement. And unlike Ethereum, the Lightning´s network equivalent of staking is available today. 

Imagine you were a large whale, and you wanted to earn a predictable yield on your Bitcoin **while retaining custody** (this last bit is key). The Lightning Network, unlike anything else in the ecosystem, would allow you to do this. Right now the fees a node can obtain for routing are very low, but this is because for now supply outstrips demand, but if the Lightning Network´s adoption continues at the rate it's at, then this will soon change.   
I can envision a near future where there are staking pools which groups together people's liquidity to create a very well-connected routing node and collect fees, redistributing them out to their clients after taking a small commission for managing the node.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**5. Makes price volatility irrelevant.**

Bitcoin's critics cite volatility as an unsurmountable problem which means it will never become a viable currency , when in fact its volatility is just a temporary feature caused by its insanely fast monetization.   
But anyway, I understand the frustration of making an on-chain transaction and having for wait 6 confirmations (roughly 1 hour) during which Bitcoin´s fiat price could have drastically shifted. This is not great for international transactions or any circumstance where you are using Bitcoin as a bridge between two fiat currencies. (Far better than anything the legacy financial system can offer, mind you).

Again problem solved with the Lightning Network, the instantaneous nature of its transactions mean that you convert instantly in fiat, locking in your agreed price. Strike and [OpenNode](https://www.opennode.com/) have shown that this is a key advantage of using the Lightning Network around which they are building their business models.  


**How you can help**

So to close out, if this little post has got you more curious about the Lightning network, here are a few things you can do to help out.

* **Run your own node** (it´s fun I promise)
* Show friends, families, local business how the Lightning Network works **and give them a demonstration**. Most people are genuinely impressed by its speed and low transaction cost when they see it with their own eyes.
* Contribute to open source code or **create services for the growing community of node runners**. There is so much still to build.
* **Reimagine how existing services could be improved when powered by the Lightning Network**.

Bitcoin and what is stands for is a worst nightmare for the likes of CCP (or any authoritarian state). Once (not if) they perceive Bitcoin as a threat to their fiat monopoly, I don't see what can stop a state such as China to clandestinely deploy manufacturing capacity for Bitcoin's ASIC. They can then perform a successful 51% attack on BTC. Lets say then BTC forks to GPU. In that case subsequent 51% attack becomes even cheaper.

2022-01-31 02:21:19,"Problems with LVL bank -- question about using Bitcoin address for multiple accounts and omniswap Hello, I've had many recordkeeping/balance problems with LVL, a USD/Bitcoin bank. I have a question for the community because what LVL is telling me makes no sense.  I've transacted many things in the past year with LVL and according to the Bitcoin blockchain, I have 1.53 BTC in my address.  Here's what it shows on explorer: 

[https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/3DG9Up4y1FnX2voi4mZfJZBpYuQ7um4FiE](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/3DG9Up4y1FnX2voi4mZfJZBpYuQ7um4FiE)

The balance showing in my LVL account, however, is zero . . . less than $1 (about 80 cents).  The company explains the reconciliation between the Blockchain (1.53) and what my account says in the LVL app (80 cents) by telling me that they use my address for other accounts.  

***""We operate using HD Omnibus hot and cold wallets. This means that many different addresses point to the same wallets, and funds are spread between hot and cold wallets for security. Therefore, the deposit address yu see in the app can correspond to more funds than just yours.  You correctly have only a small amount of bitcoin, about $.80 cents.""***

I've never heard of such a thing, using someone's Bitcoin address for hot &amp; cold swaps and then keeping a separate balance for that person in an off-blockchain ledger. I use TokenTax and other things to track my transactions, and I don't know what to do with this 1.53 BTC delta that LVL claims is part of their hot/cold swap, but, according to the blockchain, it's transactions sent to my address.  I've never heard of sharing an address among different people in the way the LVL customer service rep says.  

My next step will be to file action with a regulator and get an audit of the transactions. Before I do that, I wanted to check with the community to make sure that I'm not misunderstanding something here. Do centralized banks like LVL (or Coinbase or any other) keep different ledger balances for customers through their online access that's different than what the blockchain shows?  With, as LVL claims, the bank's offline balance as the accurate one, not the blockchain?  I'm really struggling to understand this.  Grateful for an explanation if I'm wrong.

2022-01-31 13:22:54,"Smart contracts, NFTs and DeFi on the Bitcoin network Hi everyone, apologies if this isn't allowed but I have just learned about a very interesting project which aims to build an ecosystem on the Bitcoin network - called Stacks (STX).

https://www.stacks.co/

In essence it aims to bring smart contracts to Bitcoin. If you're a massive believer in Bitcoin like myself then I personally find this a really exciting project, particularly seeing how big things like NFTs are going to be in the future I think it's really important that these can be done on THE Bitcoin network instead of other chains. In a way this project moves Bitcoin past just being a store of value which I think is a really positive step. 

From a holders point of view, it also in a way brings staking to the Bitcoin network. If you stake STX the you can earn Bitcoin (can use an exchange like Binance which is offering 18% for 30 days or go through a pool &amp; non-custodial for slightly lower). They launched on Coinbase 5 days ago so is available in a few different places.

Interested to hear people's thoughts on this! I personally think it's an exciting project and will be interested to see where it ends up

I believe massive amounts of people misunderstand the title of the Bitcoin white paper. Think of this casual statement ""Don't forget to grab a pack of smokes while you're out. There's some extra cash on the coffee table if you need it.""  From this frame of reference, it is easy to see Bitcoin as a system used to buy a pack of smoke using some kind of electronic infrastructure.  However, if we dig deeper it seems to be actually much more nuanced than that.  (Example: Bob buys milk from Sally.)  Prior to Bitcoin, it was impossible for Bob to do a cash transaction with Sally over an electronic medium (VISA, Mastercard, debit, e-transfer, Fedwire, etc...)  All of these traditional methods require middlemen, IOUs, or another mechanism to settle transactions.  This is fundamentally different than a cash transaction.  By that I mean, Bob places a $10 dollar bill in Sally's hand.  Sally then places the milk in Bob's hand. THIS IS WHAT BITCOIN INVENTED.  Bob and Sally can tap phones and Bob's Bitcoin will go from his wallet straight to Sally's wallet.

* By Chris Kuiper and Jack Neureuter
* 01/31/2022

Once investors have decided to invest in digital assets, the next question becomes, ""Which one?"" Of course, bitcoin is the most recognized, first-ever digital asset, but there are hundreds and even thousands of other digital assets in the ecosystem.

One of the first concerns investors have regarding bitcoin is as the first digital asset it may be vulnerable to innovative destruction from competitors (such as the story of MySpace and Facebook). Another common consideration surrounding bitcoin is whether it offers the same potential reward or upside as some of the newer and smaller digital assets that have emerged.

In this paper we propose:

* Bitcoin is best understood as a monetary good, and one of the primary investment theses for bitcoin is as the store of value asset in an increasingly digital world.
* Bitcoin is fundamentally different from any other digital asset. No other digital asset is likely to improve upon bitcoin as a monetary good because bitcoin is the most (relative to other digital assets) secure, decentralized, sound digital money and any ""improvement"" will necessarily face tradeoffs.
* There is not necessarily mutual exclusivity between the success of the Bitcoin network and all other digital asset networks. Rather, the rest of the digital asset ecosystem can fulfill different needs or solve other problems that bitcoin simply does not.
* Other non-bitcoin projects should be evaluated from a different perspective than bitcoin.
* Bitcoin should be considered an entry point for traditional allocators looking to gain exposure to digital assets.
* Investors should hold two distinctly separate frameworks for considering investment in this digital asset ecosystem. The first framework examines the inclusion of bitcoin as an emerging monetary good, and the second considers the addition of other digital assets that exhibit venture capital-like properties.

Now you would ask ""what is the core value of bitcoin?"" : 

&amp;#x200B;

First , the USD is sometime referred as *the petrodollar,* in simple terms it means that major *o*il producing country have to export/convert using the USD, certain countries then commit fraud or decide to go to war . The US/NATO then make sure with the strength of their army to defend what they own which then become costly for the US/NATO and even worst for the future of the country which committed to fraud/war.  Now with all the nuclear arsenal in place in numerous countries, it is delusional to not turn to bitcoin and bring the power where it belongs ! Lets switch all the bright minds that create nukes into creating nuclear fusion plants , switch the military drones workers toward a futuristic realm, protect those mining facility with the army and more.

Bitcoin core value is that anyone willing to put the energy is rewarded on a p2p decentralized and distributed manner;  you decide if you want to cut off the middle-men or to have free will over your wealth, every choice is accepted with bitcoin . 

Bitcoin isn't against the rich or the poor but it's about honesty and economic freedom ; The Bitcoin network is now secured enough to keep on going with this core principle forever.   The network is already smart and have establish by its own that eventually the computing power for transactions will be higher and more costly because it will be needed at that point of time in a future economy. 

In conclusion , here's my question for you,  bitcoiners are always happy when countries or tech like the lightning network bring bitcoin on the front stage , some of us have still forget that the energy can be use directly from the ground to your bitcoin public address and I would like to ask  you; If you were a energy producer ,instead of taking all the hard cost of moving the energy around.;  Why wouldn't you take all this energy and convert it into bitcoin?

I'd imagine running it on one of my previous phones with an external USB drive for the blocks.  I know `bitcoin.conf` can be accessed through one of the config windows in QT so perhaps I can set the `-datadir` there.  If not I can always modify the `manifest.xml` to add command line parameters

Bitcoin is the third party. It is the party of provable inclusivity, verifiable truth, actual fairness, financial sovereignty, and freedom.

Another common  consideration surrounding bitcoin is whether it offers the same  potential reward or upside as some of the newer and smaller digital  assets that have emerged.

In this paper we propose:

* Bitcoin is best understood as a monetary good, and one of the  primary investment theses for bitcoin is as the store of value asset in  an increasingly digital world.
* Bitcoin is fundamentally different from any other digital asset. No  other digital asset is likely to improve upon bitcoin as a monetary good  because bitcoin is the most (relative to other digital assets) secure,  decentralized, sound digital money and any ""improvement"" will  necessarily face tradeoffs.
* There is not necessarily mutual exclusivity between the success of  the Bitcoin network and all other digital asset networks. Rather, the  rest of the digital asset ecosystem can fulfill different needs or solve  other problems that bitcoin simply does not.
* Other non-bitcoin projects should be evaluated from a different perspective than bitcoin.
* Bitcoin should be considered an entry point for traditional allocators looking to gain exposure to digital assets.
* Investors should hold two distinctly separate frameworks for  considering investment in this digital asset ecosystem. The first  framework examines the inclusion of bitcoin as an emerging monetary  good, and the second considers the addition of other digital assets that  exhibit venture capital-like properties.

2022-02-02 09:52:20,"Bitcoin + Blood = LN growth &amp;#x200B;

I give blood (plasma) twice every week here in Chicago and it pays $250. I used to donate the money to a charity because that makes it an efficient double-whammy for good; but after I tried innocently (😁) to orange pill the charity’s board president into accepting bitcoin donations1, she went on an ESG rant. I asked why holding inflationary US dollars, supporting endless growth with mindless consumerism and staying trapped in debt cycles was a better alternative to bitcoin. In a show of orange pill theater, I took from my pocket a dollar bill and holding by its ends in both hands explained the portrait of a slavemaster and messages of god were just the cherry on top. She left me an email that night which basically said the organization no longer needed my pledge. This was in 2019. So for the past 2 years or so (there was a three month covid gap in there) I’ve been putting the $250 each week into my Electrum desktop wallet after buying BTC on Simplex (debit card). I basically planned on just using Electrum to support various BTC open-source projects every week. But I never got around to it and it kept accumulating. There’s a huge amount in there now (was six figures back in November). So now I just decided I’ll put it on a public LN node and support the LN’s growth, but probably not with Electrum because those channels are private and don’t allow for \[public\] payment routing. I understand many in the community are frightened by the security risks of such things, but I believe this is grossly overblown assuming the use of multisig and a a watchtower (second node). The vulnerabilities are really just theory; has there for example, ever been a real-life instance of someone broadcasting a previous channel state? Not sure but I’ve never heard of one. So anyway, I’m going to continue letting bitcoin incentivize my plasma giving for those in need, which will in turn help re-enforce the Lightning Network’s growth. This btw, oblivious to the ESG crowd, is similar to how bitcoin’s mining economy of scale will benefit green energy companies by improving their balance sheets, fattening their R&amp;D, and increasing their capacities. My goal is to let this LN node with all its payment routing rewards grow until entropy takes me under.

I also mine and each of my S19’s put out 75 TH/s - 85 TH/s, and after energy overhead each week make about $100-$130. The only advantage mining has had besides helping secure (decentralize) the network is that during the crash of March 2020 when BTC fell to $4000, I wasn’t donating blood, but still making BTC from mining. Still I’ve made way more money by donating blood. Mining will always have its own free market, the profit margins of which depend upon dozens of independent factors, including economic time preference. Some people with the same equipment and part of the same pool(s) will experience very different margins. I am however, interested to see how non-custodial borrowing and lending with simple Taproot-enabled SM’s/multisig could benefit home miners in the future. I should be able to collateralize my hashpower and use it like a credit card in the sub-dermal wallet in my left hand, or loan out my LN payment channel, or borrow against my BTC to buy a liquidation lot of solar panels to reduce my liability, etcetera. 

My point is most people can give plasma. It’s not just a tax write-off and hyper beneficial for healthcare applications, but if you allocate the monetary energy to bitcoin, it can over time like I experienced, add up to silly amounts.

2022-02-02 16:50:58,"Bitcoin is updated sometimes. If that's possible, how does Bitcoin stop bad actors from forcing any upgrades they want? This was a question my cousin asked me.

Here is my reply - did I get it right?  Did I miss anything?

&amp;#x200B;

Bitcoin is just a protocol. A set of rules agreed to be followed by the network participants. The rules of the protocol define how the participants will interact with each other. The rules are implemented in  software by a few independent open source projects that are all compatible with each other. Anyone can make copies of the source code from any of these open source projects, change it, build it and release a  new version of it.

But those changes will only come into effect for the users if a consensus of bitcoin miners and node operators all choose to adopt the new proposed change to the protocol all at the same time. There are probably hundreds of thousands of anonymous node operators distributed over the globe by now.  I'm one of them :-)

Any proposed changes are hotly debated by the various developer communities. No individual or small group can force a change through. It requires a consensus of network participants to all agree to run the new version. Bitcoin evolves very slowly as a consequence of that. But when a major disagreement happens and opinion is divided over a core parameter, the network splits and runs different incompatible versions causing a hard fork and the birth of a new coin. There are strong financial incentives to stick with the most popular status quo though.

When someone wants to send or receive bitcoin, the wallet they use connects to a validator node  which will be running a version of the bitcoin software chosen by the operator of that node.  My main hardware wallet is a Trezor and I have the option to connect to my own node (running on a raspberry pi!) rather than trust the one it connects to by default.",-0.9786377549171448,0.0713549085323279,0.5160934227063259,0.077,0.037,0.886,0.948

Saylor decided to make Bitcoin the company's primary treasury reserve asset in August 2020.

Not being able to find what I was looking for, I decided this morning to search for all the tweets posted by Michael J. Saylor since August 2020 announcing additional BTC purchases by MicroStrategy.

Its just being bought and held or traded as an investment or speculation.

The exception to this is obviously Silk Road.  I've also noticed what appear to me as publicity stunts where someone like a pizza shop or strip club announces they will accept BTC.  I kind of doubt they get any real sales with it.

Yes it's 45 minutes long - but if you want to actually try and help someone understand how bitcoin works 45min is nothing! (guess how long it took to read the book :P)

Any feedback would be much appreciated! Last time people said the audio was too crappy so hopefully this time I get some feedback about the actual content, such that in the end I get a video that people can send to their nocoiner friends and don't have to do all the explaining themselves each time

Can I open multiple instances of bitcoin core, all with separate file locations, and have them scan a portion of the chain, then combine all of their wallets together.

If for example, I had a 6 core cpu, and I had 6 instances scanning simultaneously, this would make the rescan time 1/6 of the usual time.

So I was like yeah, and she was about to tell me how someone got scammed (nothing to do with crypto, some person believed in false promises).

But then I told her what crypto actually is, that it is not a ponzi scheme. And she did listen to what I had to say about it and we talked about it for quite a while. She only called me because of that article and nothing else.

This got me thinking. Why don't we use ""Crypto/Bitcoin for dummies"" content such as this and share it with people who don't know the basics yet? Like print it out or something.

2022-02-05 02:52:44,"Mexico’s Third Wealthiest Man Says Bitcoin Is A Better Alternative To Fiat Money – Here’s Why  

These past years presented numerous transformations in the finance industry. And with the rise of bitcoin, more powerful financial technologies – including the influential figures behind them – are changing our concept of money and challenging the financial institutions that presently manage it. 

For instance, the third-richest person in Mexico, Ricardo Salinas, said that bitcoin is a better option than fiat money. 

 The billionaire’s reason? Digital currency is “unseizable” by a regulatory force and can be exchanged easily around the world, unlike fiat.  

 **Government Clout** 

Government intervention has always been a factor in setting the gold standard, Salinas said. “Everything we have by fiat is completely seizable by the government,” he explained.

The thing is these lies are becoming more and more of a poison. Now that Fake News is a thing nowadays, I came to believe that a great use-case for the Blockchain and its ability to record data that can not be altered.

Eventually lies will come out, there is no question that is always the case in the end. I believe now that Blockchain is here, we can now record all the bullshit that is spread on the internet, and the day the truth comes out, then that, in turn, is recorded and protected. So eventually fake news will be kept in check because of the recorded truths the Blockchain recorded and no govt, corporation, or anyone can alter it.

I promise this will circle back to Bitcoin. But first, consider the history of Amazon and its stock:

\-In 1997 the company went public. It only sold books. You could buy the stock for a split-adjusted $1.50. Today it closed at $3152.79.                                                                                                                           -That same year it began selling movies and music.                                                                                             -In 1998 it expanded beyond books, movies, and music.                                                                                     -In 2000 it began to allow 3rd party sellers to use its platform. Stocks were crashing that year but its share price stayed above $40 the first half of the year.                                                                                        -In 2002 it launched its web services. Most people had been burned by internet stocks and the share price was depressed between $10 and $20 that year.                                                                                          -In 2005 it rolled out Amazon Prime with two-day shipping. The share price fluctuated between $30 and $50 that year.                                                                                                                                                        -In 2011 it entered the video streaming market, offering instant access to 5,000 movies and TV shows for Prime members. It also sold more ebooks than paper that year. The share price hovered near $200 that year.                                                                                                                                                                       -In 2014 it bought the Washington Post, becoming a media outlet. The share price was between $300 and $400 most of that year.                                                                                                                                       -In 2022 it should pass UPS and FedEx to become the largest U.S. delivery service.                                        
\-Today the company is delving into robotics and AI. 

Nobody really saw how much Amazon would evolve and eventually change how we live. Nor did they see how much potential it's stock had to appreciate in price. The exponential returns from Amazon stock were made possible by masterfully leveraging the emergent internet. Fortunes have always been made by those who leveraged the technology of their generation: technologies like steel production, the combustion engine, electricity, transistors, etc. 

Blockchain is the technology of this generation. The technology is waiting for those who can successfully leverage it. Systems that store monetary value with integrity, staking, smart contracts, DAO’s, NFT’s, metaverses…every one of these is going to be leveraged. 

It may not look like much today, but blockchain is going to change everything. And, no one wants to hear this, but it won't all happen this year.

Looking at Amazon's historical timeline, I wonder where we are in the history of blockchain. My best guess is pre-2000. Some may remember that in 2000 before the big market crash you could open a brokerage account and the broker would talk you into buying dot-com companies. This hasn’t happened for crypto/blockchain yet. But there is a bull market coming in which the traditional brokerages will have this stuff neatly packaged into funds people can buy through their employer offered 401k’s. We are very close to that day. I think it may be as early as this year and almost certainly within the next five years.

I think a major bull market either this year or in the next few years is inevitable. If you doubt this, consider what crypto/blockchain technologies are offering us:

\-Bitcoin is an offramp into a fairer and more healthy financial system. It allows us to escape the poverty tax of inflation. No other alternative monetary system has ever gained this much traction.                                                                                                                                               -Staking is a return to high-interest savings that the central bank decimated. Now everyone can earn interest like a boomer in the 70’s and 80’s.                                                                                                               
\-Smart contracts will make sure no one ever has to make an agreement and worry about the other party’s integrity. If the pay for the Logan Paul vs. Floyd Mayweather fight had been tied up in a smart contract instead of Mayweather promotions, Logan wouldn't be wondering if he will ever receive his pay for that fight.                                                                                                                                                  -DAO’s will solve the problem of self-serving and incompetent CEO’s. Companies will be run by code which means they won’t be ATM’s solely for members of the CEO club.                                                           -NFT’s will enable the world to own amazing things without fear of theft or the inconvenience of storage, security, and transactional friction. We won’t need to worry about our $1,000,000 of collectibles sitting in a dark storage facility. We will store and display them worry-free through NFT's and when it’s time to sell them we will do so in seconds and for top dollar.

All this to say that the opportunity in front of us is bigger than most people understand. Think of it all as if you are from the future. You know how it all plays out. The big themes are in motion. The technology has gained momentum that cannot be reversed. This truly is the opportunity of a lifetime.",-0.9213224649429321,0.17479256854256853,0.4225727513227513,0.146,0.06,0.794,0.9973

2022-02-05 08:36:09,"A Bitcoin short squeeze might be happening right now, and it can completely reverse the current trajectory of the market. Bitcoin seems to have shot past its $40k barrier in a matter of hours, and it is likely to continue considering how many people are shorting the market right now. Bitcoin hasn't yet lost its steam and it was dragged down by the stock market for the past few days. This has accumulated A LOT of shorters.

&amp;#x200B;

[Short positions are extremely high](https://preview.redd.it/jqutbdvikxf81.jpg?width=1525&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e0b5a8c148455c939a8bee025ec5259d8321ada6)

Just looking at this alone should give you a picture of what has been happening. There are a lot of people that are shorting the market right now, and a Bitcoin short squeeze is likely considering that whales have been eating up the weeks long selling pressure with huge purchases.

Short Squeeze Indications

* **Substantial amount of buying pressure.** ✅
* **RSI below 30 for an unnatural amount of time.** ✅
* **Short interest way above 20%.** ✅
* **Huge sudden uptick in price.** ✅

The market indications are suggesting a textbook short squeeze scenario for Bitcoin, and that might potentially reverse the Bitcoin market's trajectory. Remember, Bitcoin is already 10% up in a matter of a few hours. This means people shorting are at a loss and they will either have to sell at a loss or borrow more shares, driving up the price.

**TLDR:** Bitcoin closed one of the biggest green candles in over a year, and it is most likely the beginning of a short squeeze due to an unusually large amount of people shorting the market. Moreover, surpassing 40k in a matter of hours just invalidated weeks of FUD. If this continues, investors will be looking at a bullish Bitcoin market and a bearish stock market which is possibly the best environment for another huge bull run.

2022-02-05 11:05:54,"CNBC: ""Bitcoin miners are helping the Texas grid brace for winter storm impact"". Great article! ...why I don't see it in r/Technology? https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/03/winter-storm-descends-on-texas-bitcoin-miners-shut-off-to-protect-ercot.html

They only post FUD about Bitcoin/Crypto, articles full of lies and misinformation. But this great factual article is nowhere to be seen there:

&gt; As a major winter storm descends on Texas, crypto miners are powering down operations to help ease the burden on the state’s already beleaguered power grid. 
&gt; 
&gt; The chief concern is that we might see a repeat of February 2021, when a deep freeze devastated large swaths of the state, leaving 10 million Texans without electricity and resulted in a multisystem meltdown that “was within minutes of a much more serious and potentially complete blackout.” Hundreds of people died amid the multiday outage. 
&gt; 
&gt; Riot Blockchain, one of the biggest publicly traded crypto mining companies in America, began shutting down power to its Rockdale mine on Tuesday, a process that occurs in phases.  
&gt; 
&gt; “As the storm has progressed, we have continued to decrease our power consumption by 98%-99%. So currently, we are only using 1%-2% of power,” said Trystine Payfer, Riot’s director of communications. Payfer told CNBC Riot will continue to manage its power usage as needed until there is “no extreme stress on the ERCOT grid.”
&gt; 
&gt; Riot’s stock closed nearly 7% lower on Wednesday, and it is down over 31% year-to-date. 
&gt; 
&gt; Several other crypto miners across Texas have followed suit in voluntarily curtailing energy consumption in the run-up to the arctic blast.
&gt; 
&gt; The CEO of Rhodium Enterprises, a fully integrated bitcoin miner using liquid-cooled infrastructure, tweeted that Texas-based bitcoin miners were curtailing their load starting Wednesday, in order to “help provide excess power reserves” for the storm. 
&gt; 
&gt; “We are proud to help stabilize the grid and help our fellow Texans stay warm,” wrote Rhodium CEO Nathan Nichols.
&gt; 
&gt; Other crypto miners said they will respond in real-time to the needs of the grid.
&gt; 
&gt; The grid is called ERCOT, which is short for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, the organization tasked with operating it. To run smoothly, ERCOT requires a perfect balance between supply and demand. Having too much power and not enough buyers is just as bad as everyone wanting to fire up their air conditioning units on the same day in July.
&gt; 
&gt; Whinstone CEO Chad Harris takes CNBC on a tour of the largest bitcoin mine in North America.
&gt; Whinstone CEO Chad Harris takes CNBC on a tour of the largest bitcoin mine in North America.
&gt; For years, ERCOT has struggled with fluctuating energy prices and sporadic service, which is why it strikes deals with flexible energy buyers, like crypto miners. Through established “demand response” programs, ERCOT will actually pay major industrial users to cut power.
&gt; 
&gt; “They’re expecting the same kind of grid load as you would have at peak summertime, so they’ll likely curtail miners at some point on Friday or Saturday,” explained Fred Thiel, CEO of Marathon Digital, another major player in the U.S. mining industry.
&gt; 
&gt; Bitcoin miners specifically, and demand response more generally, are a powerful tool in the toolbox for grid management, according to Lee Bratcher, president of the Texas Blockchain Council.
&gt; 
&gt; Marathon’s Thiel tells CNBC that miners have been coordinating with ERCOT since last week to get ahead of any potential problems with the grid.
&gt; 
&gt; “Everybody wants to collaborate, everybody wants to voluntarily do whatever it takes to support ERCOT,” he said.
&gt; 
&gt; The question now is when the baseload that miners use (the baked-in energy demand from miners as a collective) is shut down and transferred back to the grid, does that provide the grid with what it needs to keep functioning as normal?
&gt; 
&gt; “This is a key test moment for the industry,” continued Thiel.
&gt; 
&gt; Whether crypto miners going offline en masse in one of the biggest crypto mining jurisdictions in the world will move the price of bitcoin, the answer is probably no.
&gt; 
&gt; The supply delta from changing the pace of mining is typically minimal, and any price moves in bitcoin or other major proof-of-work cryptocurrencies would likely have more to do with macro factors and overall risk-off behavior.
&gt;

&gt; A war is brewing among states in the US to attract bitcoin miners
&gt; Big test for bitcoin miners
&gt; Many in the mining industry tell CNBC that the next few days are a high-stakes way of testing out whether the narrative of crypto miners being good for the grid bears out under pressure. The state’s growing crypto mining contingent ballooned after China banished all crypto miners last May.
&gt; 
&gt; “Bitcoin miners want to be good stewards of grid stability,” said Alex Brammer of Luxor Mining, a cryptocurrency pool built for advanced miners. 
&gt; 
&gt; “We are incentivized financially but also from a political narrative, and therefore, regulatory perspective. We want to show the world we contribute to the health and resilience of the grid, and we know that all eyes will be on us throughout this first big test of the year,” continued Brammer.
&gt; 
&gt; That financial incentive is key. Miners are not altruistically opting to do the grid a solid by sometimes powering down some or all of its bitcoin miners to free up electricity for those in need. Instead, there are a lot of financial perks baked into its arrangement with the nonprofit organization that operates Texas’ grid. 
&gt; 
&gt; “Imagine how much you would have to pay Amazon to say, ‘Hey, there’s too much demand for power. Please power down your data center,’” said bitcoin mining engineer Brandon Arvanaghi, who now runs Meow, a company that enables corporate treasury participation in crypto markets.
&gt; 
&gt; “But it can do that with bitcoin very easily, because all you have to do is pay the miners slightly more than what they would have made mining for bitcoin that hour,” continued Arvanaghi, who calls the setup a “a win-win.”
&gt; 
&gt; If the grid operators pay the miners a penny more than they would have made from mining in any given hour, then they’ll gladly power down. And from Thiel’s experience, they get curtailment requests less than 3% of the time in the course of a year, which he estimates comes to about five to ten hours a month.
&gt; 
&gt; Even bitcoin miners that haven’t cut a deal with ERCOT sometimes voluntarily power down at times of peak consumption when prices shoot higher.
&gt; 
&gt; The price of power per hour is all over the place, routinely going negative.
&gt; 
&gt; Shaun Connell, the EVP of power at Lancium, tells CNBC that in 2020, the price of energy in West Texas was negative between 10% and 20% of the time. The price dips below zero when supply outpaces demand.
&gt; 
&gt; In 2021, the price of power per hour was negatively priced 9% of the time, while 5% of all hours peaked above $100. Extreme tails like the ones shown in the chart below aren’t a good thing.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Scales
&gt; In 2021, had miners voluntarily cut back their uptime expectation from 100% to 95%, they would have slashed their per megawatt hour price from $178 to $25, according to data from Lancium, a Houston-based energy tech company that specializes in bitcoin mining. 
&gt; 
&gt; Strategically timed energy curtailment proves especially vital for the Texas grid, which exists as its own little island. 
&gt; 
&gt; Unlike the rest of the continental U.S. that belongs to either the Eastern or Western interconnection (the names of the two interconnected power grids linking states), 90% of Texas runs on ERCOT, a deregulated and independent network of energy providers that is not tethered to any other grid in the U.S. 
&gt; 
&gt; While this competitive market often drives down the price of power as providers compete on cost to capture customers, it also means that there is less of a safety net baked into the grid. This presents problems in the face of calamitous events, such as a power shortage or a natural disaster, like the fatal winter storm in early 2021. 
&gt; 
&gt; Adding a “controllable load resource” like bitcoin miners to the grid acts as a sort of life insurance policy. It’s almost like a hedge against disaster.
&gt; 
&gt; And it’s no skin off the back of bitcoin miners. Bitcoin has no uptime requirement, nor is the gear worn down by regularly powering off and on. It’s pretty much a win, win.
&gt; 
&gt; “That’s the beauty of bitcoin — it’s something no other industry can really do,” Arvanaghi told CNBC. “It’s very synergistic.”
&gt; 
&gt; Not everyone agrees
&gt; Not all are convinced that bitcoin miners are the solution.
&gt; 
&gt; “Miners are a strain on the grid, not a help,” said Ben Hertz-Shargel of Wood Mackenzie, a provider of commercial intelligence for the world’s natural resources sector. Hertz-Shargel is concerned that bitcoin mining would only raise peak demand, ultimately adding stress to the system.
&gt; 
&gt; Hertz-Shargel predicts that bitcoin could more than double demand growth in ERCOT’s territory, but unlike pro-crypto Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, Hertz-Shargel doesn’t think that additional demand is a good thing.
&gt; 
&gt; ″The analogy I like to use is that if you start smoking two packs a day and then cut back to one pack on holidays, that doesn’t make smoking good for your health,” he says.
&gt; 
&gt; Hertz-Shargel argues that ERCOT should be focused on grid improvements to make it easier to get power from solar and wind farms to big consumption centers, and that bitcoin miners aren’t the right way to deal with demand fluctuations. Instead, he argues, “the intermittency of renewables should be met with demand response from societally-beneficial loads, like industrial facilities, commercial buildings, and residential air conditioners — or energy storage.”
&gt; 
&gt; But ERCOT interim CEO Brad Jones thinks bitcoin miners can be helpful.
&gt; 
&gt; Jones has been touring the state and hosting public events to answer questions from Texans about the electric grid. Besides winter weather, the impact of cryptocurrency mining on the grid is a common question.
&gt; 
&gt; “I’m pro bitcoin...but I’m too risk averse to be an investor in bitcoin,” Jones told a crowd of residents in Frisco, Texas in December. The ERCOT chief went on to explain the mutually beneficial relationship between the grid and bitcoin miners.
&gt; 
&gt; “A lot of these solar and wind can produce power down to a negative power range, negative $23 per megawatt hour,” Jones said. “These bitcoins see that as a great opportunity. They can get paid to use power. And that’s why they’re coming to the state. But that’s not necessarily bad.”
&gt; 
&gt; Jones makes the point that negative power isn’t healthy for the market. Bitcoin miners “soak up” some of that negative power, and when the cost of electricity gets slightly higher than what they’re willing to pay for it (around $100, according to Jones), they shut off.
&gt; 
&gt; “So I think it’s really a valuable potential resource for us.”",-0.9842079281806946,0.11526427469135801,0.41321055487722175,0.105,0.088,0.807,0.9924

Let me first state that I believe in bitcoin-my actions buying it show that. However, belief is not enough.

I got heavily into starting to understand the monetary system in 2020 which led to gold which led to bitcoin. I have seen many with the best intentions fail. I have not made the best decisions, but I have also avoided some bad ones. Here is what I suggest:

1. Do not borrow money to buy bitcoin. You need to find a way to generate cash flow each month/week you can invest. For some, this is a 2nd job. For others, this is reducing expenses. There are people that spend $4,000 a month on drugs/alcohol and that can go to investing.

2. Have a goal of a long term savings account. If you want to trade, that's your choice, but I think people need something that they will never sell. For many I think this goal is 2-5 btc.

3. Understand your limitations. I, for one, am an awful short term term trader. You will hear stories of great traders, people with 5 computer screens, etc...most of them hide their losses. It's easy to show the wins when someone is choosing what to share. I know a lot of of people who sold over 50% of their bitcoin during the last few months. They are now in a place where they have to either get back in, trade, or I hope not but true, trade a lot on options and/or borrowed money.

4. Do not tell people how much bitcoin you have. It will only harm your relationships. If you are paying attention, you are seeing a divided society more and more so. If you have a lot of bitcoin, and it goes up, you will be viewed by many as part of the problem. 

5. DCAing is not just said for no reason. It allows a much healthier way to accumulate an asset. DCAing is not 2 weeks-4 years-minimum.

6. I was a heavy real estate investor. I still own real estate...however, besides a small condo to live in, I would NOT buy real estate as an investment unless I had at least 10 btc AND the property was high end. The simple reality is that the amount of people that will look to buy bitcoin over the coming years is multiple times higher than real estate.

7. Survive. Probably the most important. Want to sell some at $100k? Makes sense. But the worst thing you can do is try to time this and lose your money. I know zero people who bought homes before 08, sold them in 08, and rebought in 2011.",-0.9984670281410217,0.12783164983164988,0.4445829725829726,0.075,0.083,0.842,-0.8213

Nearly always with the same amount, few exceptions when I got a bonus from work etc. Basically, I wanted to go all-in but didn't have any savings, so decided to buy with max amount that I can, every month from the salary. I kinda had the idea of stacking my way to a million dollars (or euros), however long it would take. Because the way I see Bitcoin, I have no doubt it's gonna happen. Sooner if I stack more, and later if stack less.

I saw stacking sats become a meme and people posting screenshots on Twitter. But I felt like the bigger picture was missing. How much can you achieve by simply stacking sats all the time? This is my idea of a blueprint. I stack with certain amount and have been doing it for a certain while. You can take a look at the progress and get and idea how it would work for you.

In short, its gonna take time. And its gonna require patience and nerves. Bitcoin is gonna test you, and there's no shortcuts to success. My advice: start stacking, keep stacking! Promise yourself to stack at least 4 years before you even think about giving up. I document my journey here in the blog. Enjoy reading and I hope you have great success stacking sats!

2022-02-05 19:15:12,"Forget every economic theory you know, a Bitcoin future has more potential than we can even imagine Throughout history, any revolution in our ability to study a subject was accompanied by a revolution in our thinking about it. People are literally dumbing themselves down my clinging to Old concepts of the economy, money, relationships, education, and work.

What I see coming very quickly is radically different than anything we've known before.

I think this is the whole problem with economics as a field of study... You notice the properties of money are the same properties as a lump of metal or chickens.... Bitcoin is ideal money: the properties that the idea of money has are significantly different qualitatively different than a lump of metal.

It turns out things like decentralisation, unconfiscatablity, and immutability are far more important attributes of good money than divisibility, durability, etc. Attributes that help us distinguish Bitcoin from a banana, and yet this is the foundation of modern economics.

More to the point, blockchain technology is going to allow us to literally observe a living economy rather than some abstract theoretical model that may or may not correlate with these models. 

Bitcoin is the invention of the telescope, the invention of the microscope, the invention of a super Collider, genetic technology, invention of Fire, the invention of farming, the invention of the X-ray machine the invention of the computer.... a revolutionary tool that allows us to see the world in ways that we will not be ready to accept.

I've said it many times in the past, but with the addition of a few more zeroes in the core protocol or even on a second layer lightning network , a single Bitcoin can service the global economy. Not only that, but we will also be able to actually study real-time phenomena as emergent properties. I would fully expect a completely unexpected set of economic theories to emerge from this.

In short, I wouldn't put too much weight in any economic theory today! The 21st century economy is going to be radically different; not only are we going to decentralize money. We are going to decentralize relationships with MGTOW (this personal philosophy is going to achieve so much more than feminism ever could) decentralised work with democratically run worker cooperatives, decentralized education with free online learning platforms and the resurrection of apprenticeships. 

The manner in which we have arranged all of our most important relationships with each other has been designed to destroy and the gate the potential each and every one of us has Bitcoin is the world's first truly free market and we're going to build something marvellous on top of it and we don't need a bunch of old intellectual hacks holding us back!!!!!

I think it's way easier to HODL and not get stressed out by prices if you know more about Bitcoin. The more you know, the clearer it becomes how convinced you really are about it. So in the following, I've collected my favorite sources of different ways to learn more about Bitcoin for you.

**Books**

Books take time but are the best way to learn about fundamentals in my opinion. I've read both of these and can recommend them, although for Mastering Bitcoin you're likely to only be interested in the first chapters if you don't have a technical background.

* The Bitcoin Standard: [https://saifedean.com/thebitcoinstandard/](https://saifedean.com/thebitcoinstandard/)
* Mastering Bitcoin: [https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook](https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook)

**Newsletters**

Newsletters are a great way to consistently learn more about Bitcoin and keep an overview, so I'm listing a few here.

* The Pomp Letter: [https://pomp.substack.com/](https://pomp.substack.com/)
* The Bitcoin Espresso: [https://www.thebitcoinespresso.com/](https://www.thebitcoinespresso.com/)
* Ecoinometrics: [https://ecoinometrics.substack.com/](https://ecoinometrics.substack.com/)

**Twitter**

Twitter is THE source for Bitcoin news and discussions. It's definitely the fastest way to find out about what is happening.

* Dan Held: [https://twitter.com/danheld](https://twitter.com/danheld)
* Documenting Bitcoin: [https://twitter.com/DocumentingBTC](https://twitter.com/DocumentingBTC)
* Michael Saylor: [https://twitter.com/saylor](https://twitter.com/saylor)
* Rational Root: [https://twitter.com/therationalroot](https://twitter.com/therationalroot)

**Podcasts**

Podcasts are great for doing a dive into a specific topic of interest and for times when listening is more convenient than reading (commute,...):

* What Bitcoin Did: [https://www.whatbitcoindid.com/](https://www.whatbitcoindid.com/)
* Unscrypted/Speaking of Bitcoin: [https://aantonop.com/podcasts/](https://aantonop.com/podcasts/)
* Unchained: [https://unchainedpodcast.com/](https://unchainedpodcast.com/)

**YouTube**

If I'm looking for a bit more entertainment while keeping up with Bitcoin I pick YouTube. Honestly, I could use more recommendations here. I feel like most YouTube channels make FOMO/FUD worse. The only one I've seen so far that is based and that I liked is the one by Benjamin Cowen:

* Into the Crypto Verse: [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRvqjQPSeaWn-uEx-w0XOIg](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRvqjQPSeaWn-uEx-w0XOIg)

I am using those 0% introductory APR credit cards ( money created out of thin air  / cheap free money ) for my daily expenses and slowing I have been accumulating more bitcoin with my hard earned money.

I am expecting to repay the debt and asses the strategy every 6 months. If btc price goes in my favor ( up ), I could use my bitcoin as collateral to repay all the debt and then return the card. I could sell a little bit of my btc holdings to repay the whole debt as well.

Also some yield could be created of my btc holdings thru those DeFi services. ( 6.5% as today) 

The risk is if price of bitcoin drops hard, I will have some debt in the short term. It's okay since is money I can manage to repay easily and hard money will never be lost unless bitcoin goes to zero. 

If in year one this goes well, then the exercise could be repeated again and keep accumulating more bitcoin under the cost average.

It works as long as credit score is strong, you have conviction in bitcoin and your bitcoin fundamental are solid. Also, could help to push credit score.

If there happen to be a market crash, debt default and  banks decide to freeze savings accounts I am all fine since I am using their  fiat cheap currency and I my hard earned cash won't be affected.

Also, if we take inflation into account, they are the ones losing purchasing power, not me.

I believe the strategy work well in the mid and long term and has more to win than lose

From my knowledge, I would say inflation in Bitcoin is caused by supply and demand(just like any other currency) but it is less prone to be affected as the supply is quite predictable.

I also know that it is highly volatile meaning the value spikes and drops frequently.

Now if the value of Bitcoin is not stable, how is it considered resistant to inflation despite the regular swings in it's values.

A cool feature at inception would have been if Bitcoin in a wallet had not been moved for 99\* years would go back into the pool to be mined. 

So if you were keep it for generational wealth all you would have to do is move it to a new wallet to restart those 99\* years and you would be good.

Obviously its too late for this and I dont even know if it would be possible technically but always thought something along those lines would be beneficial to the network.

I understand you want bitcoin as a settlement layer for web applications, and I get that, I am beyond desperate for fully decentralized social media to take off, but this is purely about the engineering.

I believe Stacks can work. But the engineering concerns me, I don't know enough about stacks to know how it would be state resistant to censorship but I am interested.

The shitcoiners are not going to build proper DeFi social platforms, and you know why, because some of them have political pursuasions that are deeply against free speech, this position has become the norm.

From what I can tell running one means that when I use a hot or cold wallet I can connect through my node to the bitcoin network and avoid using a 3rd party server. I’m kinda curious if that means when I use a 3rd party node that it’s a security risk for me. Does this mean that when I use a 3rd party node that it can see my private keys. Also that when I look up wallet balances, there is no third party that can use my query to link to my IP address.

TLDR; Bitcoin v22.0 moves to Guix so that we can ""trust the compiler"" even less

`&lt;tinfoil_hat_fud&gt;`

With any software that handles finance or private keys, the question of trust is important.  Most have a general concept of this stuff, and that is usually fine for most anyone's needs.  But there is always the rare case where trust policies are too laxed and users get burned, like the [Electrum v3.3.3 phishing attack](https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/issues/4968).  Here I'll try to go through the minimal level of trust all the way down to the theoretical limit of what can be done.  At the heart of the matter is the concept of extended trust.  In most trust-tests, we start with something that has more trust and see if we can connect it to something with less trust.  I'll walk through a few examples from the top down.  In general we will go through the following levels:

1. Trust the site
2. Trust the builders
3. Trust the compiler
4. Trust the kernel
5. Trust the hardware

### Trusting the site

When downloading software such as bitcoin-core, at a minimum it is important to ensure you download from `bitcoin.org` and not some site like `download.com`.  If you grab software from a sketchy site, it may come packaged with code to steal your keys (See ""Electrum phishing"" above).

In the realm of ""trusting the site"" there are those who trust the browser to get you to `bitcoin.org` and others who are more paranoid and will ensure that SSL is enforced.  Unfortunately, unless the site uses something like DNSSEC, DANE, or other cryptographic domain verification, you can just never be sure.  Attacks like bitsquatting and dns-poisoning can get past even the best intentions of DNS security.  So... sites can't be trusted.

### Trusting the builders

In most cases, trusting the builders is the what most recommend.  This process completely ignores WHERE the binaries were taken from (even `download.com`) and instead rely on a builder's cryptographic signature delivered with, or embedded in, the file.  These are usually either GPG signatures or CodeSigning certificates like Authenticode.  Main issues here is that many user's don't know WHO the builders are.  In many cases, most simply assume that a trusted product, must have a trusted package owner / builder.  A recent example of where this went horribly wrong was when ownership of a popular JavaScript library was left to a randome contributor.  The new owner went about [crafting back-doors to steal bitcoin](https://www.theregister.com/2018/11/26/npm_repo_bitcoin_stealer/).  Since JavaScript is interpretive, it was quickly spotted, but it shows the danger of entrusting new package builders or maintainers.  Clever projects (like bitcoin) get around this problem by having reproducible builds.

Reproducible builds are a way to design software so that many community developers can each build the software and ensure that the final installer built is identical to what other developers produce.  With a very public, reproducible project like bitcoin, no single developer needs to be completely trusted.  Many developers can all perform the build and attest that they produced the same file as the one the original builder digitally signed.

In most situations, those who are not developers are fine to stop here.  Just insist that the software you use is open-source, well audited, reproducible, with multiple maintainers who all attest to the same verified compiled binaries.  Bitcoin meets this test on all counts

### Trusting the compiler

For those who may fear an evil cabal of developers, or feel their project is not audited enough, the next level down is to trust nothing but the compiler.  These users will build the project from source code removing the need to trust the project builders.  Many may imagine that this is the furthest down the ""rabbit hole"" this topic can go, but in actuality it isn't.  In a 1984 award speech, the recipient, Ken Thompson, posited the question ""Should you trust your compiler?"".  He goes on to outline a method called the ""[Trusting Trust Attack](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/358198.358210)"".  Since even the most paranoid users usually trust the compiler, Ken suggested the compiler is the perfect place to put your Trojan.

The basics of this attack are due to the fact that to make a new compiler binary, you generally use the last compiler binary.  But what if compiler binary had malicious code to infect new binaries.  This is particularly problematic since compilers building compliers goes back pretty far.  Android was made with Linux that was made from Minix.  Apple was made with BSD and BSD was made from Unix.  These build genealogies go back decades.  So what if the original Unix back in the 60's had a trojan in the compiler that has been carried forward for the last 60 years?

As involved as this sounds, there have been many proof of concepts done to prove the attack's viability.  And with distrust of state security agencies getting worse year after year, it's not hard to imagine that some agency would want to pull off such attack.  The main attack ""surface"" here are what builders call the ""seed binaries"".  These are the previous versions of compiler and tools needed to build the next compiler.  If you can ""seed"" your build with a smaller set of binaries then, in theory, you may get the set so small that examination, byte for byte, could look for ""bad code"".

In version 22.0, bitcoin moved to the [Guix build system](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v22.0/contrib/guix/README.md) for their official builds.  This reduced the ""weight"" of those seed binaries [from 550 MB down to 120 MB](https://guix.gnu.org/blog/2019/guix-reduces-bootstrap-seed-by-50/).  The Guix team is prototyping a new compiler build with a reduced seed weight of [357 bytes](https://www.joyofsource.com/we-did-it.html).  That's a reduction of 99.999935% from the binary seed weight of Bitcoin v0.21.2

This claim is a bit hyperbolic, but less than you might think.  The complier build requires a proto-complier (mes) and a shell (guile).  This reduction is only for `mes` not `guile`.  Though there is work to do the same reduction on `guile` that was done on `mes`, but that may still be a few years out.

### Trusting the Kernel

Implicit in the trust of the compiler is the trust of the kernel and OS that the compiler is running on.  So if a trusting-trust trojan decided to propagate and infect in both a compiler and kernel, then reducing your binary seed may not be enough.  This is a harder attack to pull off since a 357 byte seed build will likely be hand audited for the first few iterations.  The trojan would need to know to infect the process far enough along to where it wasn't visible any more.

The solution to this is to bootstrap your compiler build, without a kernel.  This can be done up until a point.  The hex assembler and macro assembler can be loaded directly out of a legacy bootloader (think 0x7C00) and work is ongoing in in the `stage0` project that helped in the `mes` bootstrap.  But realistically, I'm not sure how far they can take this.

### Trusting the Hardware

Imagining if you could bootstrap without the kernel, there is still the trust of the hardware.  A builder is trusting that the processor and instruction pipeline is not doing something malicious if it detects a compiler bootstrap is in place.  Although this is pretty deep paranoia, people are still thinking about this stuff.  The reduced `mes` bootstrap is working to have a `x86` and `arm` bootstrap independent of each other.  Although one can be cross-compiled on the other, it was thought to be better if `arm` software didn't have to trust `x86` hardware for a bootstrap, and vice-versa.

`&lt;/tinfoil_hat_fud&gt;`

I was thinking about what would happen if bitcoin were  suddenly illegal in the U.S. as happened in China, and I realized some  good things might come of it. Firstly, who likes being taxed on bitcoin?  Sure, you can avoid it by staying away from big exchanges, but it's  still difficult to navigate, and most people just break down and sign up  with Coinbase. Since the U.S. is such a large market for crypto (and  for everything else), the software infrastructure is geared towards  satisfying it. This would mean no big exchanges that require your  information. Hearken back to the olden days of illegal weed in every  U.S. state, where there were no marijuana taxes or regulations, only  laws that were sometimes enforced. Making weed illegal created a  black-market economy. The point being that making something illegal  doesn't stop people from using it; rather, it encourages solutions to  the problems that require subversion. It would encourage more  pseudonymous creation of decentralized software. It would force people  to leave large centralized exchanges. I'm sure those who see crypto as a  new form of micro-payments wouldn't be pleased, but to me, this is  bigger than buying your Starbucks latte with little doggy coins.

**Crypto exchange are top consumers of Bitcoin Block Space, Binance no.1**    
 

Crypto exchanges are now the largest users of the #Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain, taking over 40% of that space and finding chain analytics company Glassnode with related transactions. The division of blockchain used by crypto exchanges represents a general upward trend,” It further confirms the story of ""Funda mentalization of Bitcoin's financial assets"", analysts say. 

Importantly, only a small number of exchanges consume the majority of block space.  

Observers have found that “by far” the largest blockchain users are the major crypto exchanges #Binance and #Coinbase.  

“Transactions involving the sending or receiving of funds to and from exchanges, as well as exchanges' internal transactions, occupy roughly 40% of Bitcoin block space,” per Glassnode.  

Transfers to #Binance already occupy some 15% of all block space, while transaction transfers, including #Coinbase, are responsible for some 10%. 

The company is exploring ways to measure Bitcoin growth related to SegWit; It was decided to introduce a “spotlight” on the exchange and introduce a new matrix to measure SegWit usage. SegWit (Separate Evidence) is a 2017 upgrade to the Bitcoin network aimed at scaling up. 

Although Coinbase fully embraces SegWit, Binance's SegWit adoption rate is ""minor"" as measured by 10% by the end of 2021. However, SegWit Adoption Matrix ""Improper"" increases adoption by 50% by 2020-2021; ""SegW is highly customizable. It is used in five ways in Binance transactions,"" said the SegWit Utility Matrix, which uses only 1 in 10 of the inputs used by Binance to generate payments from analysts. 

Even this 50% number is “seems inadequate” because of the amount of block space taken by the exchange, Glassnode notes. 

The company found that of the 18 exchanges surveyed using the SegWit application method, six fully accepted SegWit, six were ""struggling"" with the adoption and six had ""little effort"" to accept it.

&amp;#x200B;

 As many did find out already by study my work,  
they do known that English is not my language at all,  
what does not mean I will disclose it. 

 Some of You will ask, how will I identify myself, well,  
soon or later.  


This is not that difficult. I will sign the early bitcoins  
with my private key, and all will known I was the  
creator...  


Our private keys do serve as proof of identity.  


However.  


To reveal my identity will only provide the world some  
major news in the magazines and papers.  


So I wait some time until the financial system is converted  
completely. 

 Yes.  


The currency itself is unbreakable, well, until Quantumcomputers are in place in the household.  


One of the ideas so far was to stop the financial elite  
to press free money out of thin air.  


There was a need of a form of money which was independant  
of any government or financial institute.  


You can not create gold or cryptocurrency as the way You do with fiat currency.  


You all known by now, what I did known about, well 10 years ago, that the paper money is a belief system, manipulated.  


Currently, the financial markets do manipulate by their techniques the course of the bitcoin versus fiat currency.  


So they want to make advantage of the manipulations to gain more fiat currency, such as dollars.  


So the do ride the wave !  


You will see, the curve of the bitcoin will go down, up, down, up. It will fluctuate a lot.  


This is perfect for those markets to gain more fiat currency.  


Governments will step in to stabilize, like the gold rush, there will be a bitcoin rush.  


So to answer Your question again, yes, it is manipulated by interaction of trades in the financial markets.  


But this game will only take a few monts, years because it kills the fiat currency, and finally the cryptocurrency  
will be the only thing that will be left.  


You can not trade in a modern world with computers, tablets and mobiles with pure gold. But You can with cryptocurrency. 

&amp;#x200B;

   
In 5 years, there will be only cryptocurrency.  


After all, look to Your dollar bill, it is  
a paper made that way it is hard to copy  
as it has an unique number.  


So the idea did raise to simple create unique hashes  
and a system to block double-spending.  


The double spending problem was a hard one to solve, until  
we did look close to the torrent network...  


It will exist in 5 years from now, of course.  


The algorythm can be adapted to more enhanced code, but the principle will stay.  


Until of course, the world decides to ditch money.... 

   
It is not a setup, it was invented by me and huge rewards should go  to other people who are computergeeks and did join the project.  


If  the elite does find a way to abuse it, currently to speculate on it on  the financial markets or in future to make quantum computers into  operation, You can not blame us or  
anyone who did made this project a huge success.  


Do not get me wrong. I, neither a lot of those who did implement this idea, this innovation, became rich of the   
bitcoin.  


Those who do get rich are those who did step in after the process to create the system.  


In the early days, we did had fun to give each other for free hashes....or....bitcoins.... 

 Most of the coding was the work of the people who did step in into the idea.   


I still remember the good days of IRC... Internet was not for the masses and most people were very skilled and idealistic.  


Then I initiated the debate on the newsgroup of computergeeks and the ball started to roll. 

   
Well a few years ago, a lot of people did think it would never be that big as today...  


Bitcoin mining is not profitable right now, except You do invest a lot of money in ASIC hardware.  


Using  heavy calculations it was possible, in the early days, to mine with  your cpu. Some smart guys found a better way. The GPU of the graphics  card. The latest approach is the ASIC hardware...  


However, when people do buy hardware to mine, the difficulty is raised up to find the right hashes.  


In  this regard, You need to be very carefull what You do, what you do buy,  then it is a run to mine, because the difficulty does raise up and some  hardware equipment does not return enough ROI (return of investment).  As the hardware will be outdated after some months, years as well.  


Right  now You can earn dollars with the practice to buy and sell bitcoins, as  You would play on the stockmarket. However keep in mind, after a few  months, the fiat currency will convert to cryptocurrency anyway...  


Also keep in mind the cryptocurrency is made to do real financial transactions, not to gamble !  


When  the difficultylevel is high enough it will be much more difficult to  mine and I am pretty sure, by then, the fiat money has lost it's  credibility.  


Cryptocurrency allows the people to pay each other without banks and government, so this is all about. 

 

what do you say about this one?

I could read that thread with the old good fashion   
anonymizer.....   


I do not like to be traced down, as I do use a chain of proxies to talk, we do known our friends not by name  
but by keys....  


Anyway.  


But I did read the thread and I feel a bit sad.  


I quote the words of that man:  


hey  man, making money wasn't the point! It was for the people! for the  Revolution! We busted our ass making this perfect for the people of the  earth and now your telling me  
your going to dump on us just like that, thanks for the help.  
\[/i  
He is right, maybe he is one of the team who did join the project.  


But he is not the source of the idea. I am that source.  


But I feel happy they have still the idealism we did   
discuss at that time all together on the newsgroup and  
the IRC chat.  


When I read such things, I still belief in a good world.  


I say, man does reward, but the reward of satisfaction and the reward of the Lord is much higher as any reward of man.  


How would the world be if there were not idealistic people, a lot of them did work days, months, years for free !  


Look to the opensource community, torrent, ... 

 You known.  


Crypto-currency is a mariage of the torrent system, PGP  
and math of course.   


Both systems were made and realized by idealistic people.  


How many people did start on the internet to provide at risk,  
for free, information, software, music, movies....  


They did consider this, created by someone, but for use  
for the community.  


That thought You do find in the opensource community.  


But in world of competition, each fights against each other  
to have the best piece of the cake.  


In my perception, this is not the perfect way to make  
fast progress as a team, as people on this planet.  


Look what is happening in Fukushima right now.  


If the world does not work together, it can poison all fish in the world.  


Japan can clearly not handle the situation.  


It learns, that cooperation is the key.  


I hope this will be learned very fast, because rich or poor, all people will have contaminated fish !

2022-02-08 21:01:58,"Bitcoin Mining ETF Launches Today The Valkyrie Bitcoin miners exchange-traded fund (ETF) is slated to launch on Nasdaq today, representing another step closer to a true Bitcoin ETF.

Details: Valkyrie’s mining ETF, which will be under the ticker WGMI, will have 80% of its assets in securities focused on Bitcoin mining or software for the practice of mining Bitcoin. Up to 20% of the assets could include Bitcoin.

Previously: Valkyrie first proposed its ETF in a filing to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) last month.

Background: The SEC approved the first Bitcoin futures ETFs last year, which are funds that track Bitcoin contracts instead of the actual cryptocurrency. The SEC could finally approve of a spot Bitcoin ETF, which has direct exposure to the crypto, later in 2022. Today’s launch is a step in the right direction.

Final Thoughts: The SEC has recently delayed requests to approve a spot Bitcoin ETF, but traders remain optimistic that it will get approved this year.

Shouldn't that be an issue with how we all get out power?""

Is there anything that is legitimately a con to Bitcoin? The only thing I could think of was the fact like cash, once it's lost or a transaction is processed, that's it. No going back. There's no undo. Unlike credit, you can't just do a charge back etc.

So here is what I seek to do, as I haven't any Bitcoin nor I intend to own/invest in :  


\- I go to a platform where cryptos are traded  
\- Enter my amount of dollars ( lets's say I want to spend 100$ )  
\- The platform instantly convert the 100$ in bitcoins, which are sent to the sellor

\- The end

For example, as of writing this post, we are currently on Bitcoin block 722,496-- am I able to send BTC or receive BTC within a block 3 blocks prior? Or how about going 10 blocks prior? 

Or is it that once the block is officially mined and all the transactions in it are verified, then it becomes impossible for the block to append new transactions in it? (i.e. the Bitcoin genesis block, and subsequent blocks after, has only 1 transaction in it, the 50 BTC mining reward at the time, and it hasn't changed since)

Which brings me to the second part of my question, if it is true that nothing can be appended after the block is finalized... then what happens when all of the 21M Bitcoins are mined? If no more transactions can be appended within existing blocks, then it will just be a store of value at that point??

*“The problem with decentralized exchanges like Bisq,”* people say, *“is that shady people use it to wash money and evade the law, and you’ll end up getting tainted bitcoin or money from CashApp and bank accounts being watched by the FBI.”*

# Bullocks

I’ve done, in the last 12 months, 300 transactions  (daily DCA) with over 200 unique individuals on Bisq. Most of the time I’m buying bitcoin, but I've sold bitcoin there too. I’ve purposely sent the bitcoin I’ve acquired on Bisq to Coinbase and Binance (international), before dispatching it to cold storage or spending apps. Never had a problem. CashApp never a problem. Zelle (and they love banning people) never a problem. Bank never a problem. Strike never a problem.

I also know plenty of people who use Bisq, and the only problem they ever had was people not showing up to F2F (face to face) meetings. Most of this F2F happens in Las Vegas because there’s a bunch of professional outfits there either arbing or balancing the books for offshore and small sportsbooks, many of whom use bitcoin exclusively.

Bisq deserves the hardest to learn, easiest to master award for DEX’s. I really wish they’d get a Peter North sized load of funding, dramatically improve the platform, kill the friction, incentivize the masses, and prepare for the inevitable bond madness that bitcoin will bring in the next couple years. They could use CKbunker/HSM type stuff for hard wallets, integrate the LN and nodes too. A lot.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dytv20i51yg81.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=911fe7bbbacd9a34d1fcaa7d28086fc338fdcafe

Now what about that non-KYC bitcoin that mainstream talking points and some on this sub like to FUD? According to them, KYC bitcoin will soon trade at a premium to “tainted” bitcoin. I mine at home with a few ASICS and host a few more with Compass Mining. All of that is non-kyc bitcoin paid directly from the coinbase my mining pools earn. I sell this on Bisq (and another DEX) advertised as virgin Bitcoin with a small forensics report proving it's unblemished. I figured this could be a great business model for small miners, and list this at a 10% premium to the Bisq aggregate BTC average. You know what? I’ve had no success. Every once in a blue moon I’ve made a sale. I dropped the premium to 5% and had marginally more success, and the buyers of it are more likely than not uninformed, because here’s the folly of all that non-KYC BTC nonsense: 

# When a stranger sells you their bitcoin, it becomes non-KYC. 

That’s precisely why decentralized exchanges are so important. That’s precisely why the LN is so important. That’s precisely why *#getonzero* which trends on Twitter every so often is so important.

If you're not well aware of NSA's ability to identify supposedly anonymous TOR routes then you should figure out a little more about the general idea of anonymity of the internet and how poisoned gateways are able to identify you anyway once they are allowed to participate on your network. 

The whole fycking thing goes in the toilet if Russia does what it is proposing which is that every Russian transaction must be transparent to the FSB.

That means every time you sell or transfer coin it might be to a Russian who then acts as a mirror to the FSB who is simply a poisoned node on the network.

Bitcoin adoption is progressing at a rapid pace, although some would still like to see things move faster. Let's face it, Bitcoin already has just over 130 million users. This is huge when it was launched just 13 years ago. Bitcoin is now on the same level as the Internet was in 1997.

When you see how the adoption of the Internet exploded after that, you quickly realize that the potential for growth in Bitcoin adoption in the coming years is immense.

We know that there will be three phases in the mass adoption of Bitcoin:

* Bitcoin as a store of value
* Bitcoin as a means of payment for everyday life
* Bitcoin as a unit of account

There will obviously be challenges in achieving mass adoption of Bitcoin in these three phases.

Correlation is not causation, but what is causing this synch?

The longer you study Bitcoin, and get a deep understanding of not just Bitcoin, but the network, fiat currency, the history of money, inflation, and central banks, the more you will view Bitcoin as a risk off asset. Bitcoin is something you will find yourself running to in times of market turmoil. If you were trying to buy as much as possible with Bitcoin recently in the low $30k; you get it.

Institutional demand and investment has arrived. What has not arrived is the large funds/family funds understanding of Bitcoin.

WealthSimple, a very popular online banking/investments service in Canada that is very crypto-friendly, has up until recently allowed bitcoin purchases and deposits on their platform but not withdrawals to external wallets. This always made me stay away from their crypto side, even though I use them for other investments.

They JUST announced that you can now withdraw to external wallets and cold storages! 🎉

This is huge. Suddenly every retail-level stock investing Canadian that uses Wealthsimple has the means to buy/sell investments can now withdraw their virtual assets/digital currencies on the same investing platform they already use, with very likely less fees than they would pay on other exchanges. We can now use a well-known, Canadian, CIDC and IIROC insured platform rather than an out-of-country exchange.

...Sorry I know Canada might not be massive on the importance-scale for many of you but I live here so this is RAD.

Almost everyone around me thought this was a ""cute"" idea for the younger generation. When I spoke about how everyone regardless of age could benefit from Bitcoin they shrugged it off. 

When I talked to those same people in the last year about the power of Bitcoin they still do not believe in it or trust it. They do not like the idea that they cannot ""touch it"" to prove that it is there. Likewise they do not know enough about Bitcoin to feel good about investing in it. I reminded them that Bitcoin is not only to be viewed as an investment, I myself have used it in transactions in the past. I did ask every single one of those older people how they feel about the US dollar. My exact words were ""do you trust the US Treasury, do you trust the Federal Reserve, do you trust ...

Consider the story of Mark Cuban, billionaire and co-star of *Shark Tank*. He’s a guy who regularly tells people what they should be doing to be successful in business and finance, but he lost $200,000 trying his hand at a form of crypto investing called “yield farming,” where you buy crypto “tokens” and lend them back to the platform to earn interest.

2022-02-11 11:29:38,"Bitcoin is the greatest contribution towards the world peace ever invented Allow me to tell a story for you. Long time ago, there were a group of men primitive men. These men were strong but lacked other talents, and so they raided productive men to get goods they lacked. Over time these strong men had troubles of finding productive men, as strong men were universally avoided, productive men refused to produce anything as they were raided frequently, or strong men became lazy as following constantly productive men was hard work.

Therefore, the strong men made an innovation: they proposed to productive men they would cease raiding if they provided a fraction of their goods annually, and even better offered to provide protection against other strong men. The productive men accepted this, as they could finally live in peace without fear of violence and focus on their own matters. 

Naturally, that was a lie.

This is how the first cities were founded, as well the taxation, and this was the story of human race until invention of bitcoin. Before bitcoin, no matter was it a Roman Emperor, a Caliph, or a Feudal Lord the strong men could always raid the productive men, seize their earthly goods and tax them with impunity. In Gulag, Solzhenitsyn wrote the state literally tortured their all citizens in order to gain all private precious metals in their vaults, and the productive men could only protest by not being productive, hence the state eventually fell.

Bitcoin fixes all of this, breaking the oldest cycle of mankind: the government seizing the assets of their citizens. Bitcoin cannot be devaluated, forged, copied, confiscated nor raided. It cannot be taxed, restricted or tariffed. With bitcoin, the state is demanded to prove they actually have the wealth they claim to hold, they cannot manipulate the finances anymore with complex language and number games like they used to do. Every transaction is public, the people will know exactly who receives the money and when. Inflation, hyperinflation and excess corruption will become a thing of the past, like famines, plagues and illiteracy have, and the next generation will wonder why these were a problem in the first place? And to make things even better for everyone, bitcoin will be in permanent deflation, meaning if you work your ass of in your 20s and 30s, the value of your money is guaranteed to increase over time, a completely opposite of the fiat currency!

I am sure there are many other ploys governments all over the world have attempted, these were only a few of them. Even if a new totalitarian reign rises, they can never seize all bitcoin their citizens have, as their citizens can have multiple wallets and the government cannot imprison their whole population permanently. Sure, they will get some, perhaps even majority, but not everything and once that is spent the regime fall like they always have.

This is the true power of bitcoin, the ultimate goal of Satoshi. Sure, it will make you rich while slaying fiat, but making you rich was never the main goal. Once bitcoin has killed the fiat dragon, the states have to accept new reality and behave according to it. For the first time since rise of the cities and invention of taxation, the strong men cannot anymore bully the productive men, and so 99% of all violence plagued by mankind will become obsolete.

5% for someone with $10m is $500k (10 btc)

And to top it all off bitcoin only has 1% global adoption and is only 1% of the way to its potential market cap meaning there's still potentially 100x adoption and 100x price appreciation to come.",-0.999833345413208,0.05206349206349206,0.5431746031746032,0.072,0.046,0.883,0.6249

2022-02-11 18:55:31,"""Bitcoin is not a safe haven for 'criminals'""... Isn't this a problem? While I'm something of a Bitcoin maxi, and I think the transparency of Bitcoin in institutional contexts (government, primarily) is inspiring, this strikes me as a very 'first world problems' thing to say with respect to the transactions / holdings of a pleb like me, because the definition of ""criminal"" depends heavily on where one lives.

For example, in many countries homosexual behavior IS ""criminal behavior""... If a homosexual in one of these countries depends on something like Bitcoin for daily transactions, wouldn't that suggest their behavior could be influenced by the blockchain's transparency (i.e. if you know you're being watched by your government)?

So my question to this community is: Without more anonymity, how does Bitcoin becoming legal tender NOT result in behavior modification with respect to a blockchain monitoring government?

And please don't say people should just ""leave their country"" because for most that's not a viable option, AND it misses the point about behavior modification. Remember: thinking you're free is not the same thing as BEING free... and it seems to me that saying ""Bitcoin is not a safe haven for criminals"" implies the speaker believes whoever is a criminal today is (and should be) a criminal tomorrow.",0.6778469085693359,0.08194444444444444,0.5226851851851853,0.105,0.14,0.755,-0.8636

2022-02-11 21:45:12,"People can say otherwise but Bitcoin is by far the most decentralized cryptocurrency... When people talk of cryptocurrency, they usually think that all cryptocurrencies are decentralized. While most cryptos are made in that vision, not all live up to that distinction.

In simple terms, decentralization refers to the ability to perform financial transactions without a third-party intermediary overlooking the transaction. But there is more to it than just that.

**No central authority:** Cryptocurrency is maintained by a network of distributed computers, and this network is open to all. The same goes for data, there are no central storage or data servers for a decentralized currency.

**Decision making**:  The decision-making is based on the *consensus mechanism* that takes into account everyone involved in the network. It is usually not controlled by one leader or a small group of powerful individuals.

**Issuance:** The issuance of a decentralized currency is often dictated by the defining parameters which were drafted during its inception. The beauty of it is that it cannot be manipulated or tampered with.

**Use:**

&gt;*Anyone and everyone can use a decentralized currency.*

There is no need for approval, ID checks, or geographical restrictions to use a decentralized currency. It is open to everyone and anyone around the globe.

\------------------

Bitcoin is one of the few currencies that fulfill all the above criteria.

Bitcoin does not have a single person or team working on its development. Instead, there is a network of developers that follow a consensus mechanism to decide the network's future.

Bitcoin nodes are spread out all across the globe, although there is a higher concentration of them in the USA and Germany.

Bitcoin mining is open to all but the highly competitive process that does make a few mining giants more powerful and profitable. But surprisingly compared to other cryptocurrencies it is still more distributed.

The *volume of BTC traded* in exchanges stands at $34 Billion, putting it in the 2nd spot in the top cryptocurrencies traded by volume in a 24H period.

While the *total BTC addresses* currently stand at 918K.

Chatting to my Dad, I found out he bought £250 about 4-5 years ago through some guy who called him, within a week his investment when down to £150 and he said to his guy 'ah screw it I want out'. I think he was just nervous, with BTC being still fairly new. His guy apparently said he could only get his investment back when there's £200 worth to draw out. So my dad basically said he kissed the cash goodbye and forgot about it, presumably assuming all this Bitcoin malarkey wouldn't last. Until... I started telling him about my own dabbling. Hence I found out this story. And we worked out his investment would now we worth a few thousand £, and I was going to help him to start digging around his emails to see how we might be able to get hold of his account or the person who set it up for him.

Today, totally coincidentally, someone calls him up 'from Blockchain' to say they can get him his £250 investment back (but it'll cost him £150 - they apparently them put him through to the UK's  Financial Services Compensation Scheme) and that they want to free up his 0.3 BTC 'because he hasn't done anything with it'. My dad couldn't figure out if that meant he'll get his entire 0.3 BTC or if they meant free it up to go back into circulation. Dad asked me if I can speak to them Monday cos he is at a total loss at what to do. (And I want to question these people to see if they're legit anyway).

And so. I have a few questions! And was hoping some wonderful people here might be able to answer them.

1. First of all does that sound fishy to you, that last bit about a guy from blockchain calling my Dad and putting him through to FSCS?
2. Someone can clearly tell that the BTC is his, but as noobs we are not sure how they were able to identify him - but this does give me hope that we can find evidence that the BTC is his.
3. If this BTC is accessible then, scam or no scam, someone knows it's there and believes it's available to be had. Any ideas as so whether this original broker person from 4-5 years ago would have a key to his wallet or something, or would only the owner of the wallet would have the key?
4. How would we go about finding his wallet ourselves - where do we look, and what do we search for? Are names attached to records for the public to search? And if he doesn't have the key and no-one else does either, am I right in thinking that BTC is burned?

I am immensely grateful for any insight, and thanks in advance!",-0.9974053502082825,0.13410395750821283,0.5025490466979828,0.096,0.026,0.878,0.9903

Imagine somebody has a single block of Gold that weighs 21 million Kg’s. The Block of Gold is kept in a secret secure location. We will call the owner Satoshi. 

They decide they want to sell it to anyone that is interested in buying. Patrick comes along and says I want a piece of that Gold, but I can only afford to buy 1 gram. Satoshi says fine give me $100 and its yours but one condition, I refuse to cut off a piece and give it to you, but I will provide a certificate of ownership for 1 gram of my block, i.e., a receipt. 

To keep a track of who owns that piece of Gold, Satoshi records the details in a Ledger. It now says that Patrick owns 1 gram but for privacy reasons Satoshi does not want to put his name in the Ledger. How do you assign ownership without using his name?

The answer is to use the unique receipt number in the Ledger and the Ledger now says receipt number A1234 owns 1g of the gold block and Satoshi owns the rest. For added security the pages of the ledger were made indestructible, and the ink used for writing records was indelible.

What happens if Patrick needs to sell his Gold because he wants a new car? He says to Spongebob, I will sell you my 1g of Gold for $200. Spongebob asks to see the Gold. Well, I can’t show you the Gold but I can show you my proof of purchase and the Ledger is available online so you can look it up and check how much I own. Of course, Patrick can check the Ledger against the receipt number but there is no way to determine if the proof of purchase receipt is genuine or a copy, or in fact if Patrick had previously sold the Gold to someone else.

Satoshi had thought that might be an issue, so he devised a system to resolve the problem. Every receipt number would lock up further use of that piece of Gold unless it was unlocked by the owner. The system was modified so that when you buy a piece of Gold the buyer for security reasons is the one that creates the receipt number that goes in the Ledger (The locking key or Blockchain address) and the means of proof of ownership (The Unlock Key). Using cryptography to generate the keys ensures that the unique unlock key is the only key that will work with the locking key.

So, Patrick can only transfer the ownership to Spongebob if he can provide proof of ownership which he does with the unlock key. He then sends a message back to Satoshi to say please update the ledger to show that SpongeBob’s receipt number is now the owner of the Gold. Satoshi scores a line through the entry that says Patrick’s receipt is the owner and adds a new entry showing SpongeBob’s receipt as the new owner. Given Spongebob generated the new receipt number he now holds a new unique unlock key.

Now replace Gold with Bitcoin and you know how the Blockchain works. There are 21 million BTC each divisible into 100 million units, but for reasons beyond this description they were made available for sale through a distribution system. Satoshi needed to incentivize people to maintain the ledger for him/her, so decided to lock up all the BTC and only give it to those Ledger editors (Miners) as a reward and it would happen every 10 minutes. The reward would be given to the miner that did the fastest work. This is the only way to release new BTC into the system.

After a short while the system became difficult for average people to use so applications were developed to help people buy and sell their BTC. The apps were called wallets. The wallets kept a track of every receipt number you own and therefore the total balance of your assets. They also managed the transfer of ownership. In our example Spongebob as the recipient of the sale, would open his wallet and ask it to generate a receipt number (Blockchain address) for the ledger and a matching unlocking key that he would protect with his life, so that he could prove ownership when he decided to sell his BTC. He provided the receipt number to Patrick the seller, who entered it in his wallet as the person he was transferring ownership to. 

The wallet packaged up the details of how much to send and to what address and sent a message (A transaction) to everyone on the blockchain. On route to the ledger, the details of the transaction were validated by everyone who saw it. Finally, it was received by a miner and processed along with many others.  The miner who did the fastest work was given the authority to write it on a new page of the official ledger and rewarded for their work with a release of a small amount of new BTC. Because the miner spent money on equipment and electricity, their costs were also covered in the form of transaction fees. Every transaction included a small reward paid for by the BTC seller that was also given to the winning miner.",-0.9999266862869263,0.1038133435192259,0.6434767846532551,0.082,0.03,0.889,0.9914

2022-02-13 06:57:49,"Bitcoin is about freedom As humans, we require somewhere to park the value of our efforts across space and time. This is the primary function of a tool called money.

Since 1971 (when the U.S. defaulted on its gold debt to other sovereign nations) and until 2009, people have been deprived of a sovereign store of value. We can run through the list together.

Gold and precious metals have been seized and manipulated countless times by governments and central banks.

Real estate is taxed and over the course of 30 years you will lose a majority of the purchasing power you invested into it. Not to mention the pain in the ass that it is. I just understand 1 house in your portfolio to live in. But aside from that it doesn't make sense to use real estate as a form of wealth protection.

Stocks are manipulated and controlled by Wall Street, Central Banks, and the government (look at the meme stock hype for evidence and the illegal naked shorting that resulted from it).

Bonds are return free risk (thank you Peter Schiff). When the return for a bond is 2% and inflation is 7.5%, then your real rate is -6.5% at best. And that's with massaged government inflation statistics.

Speaking of inflation, the idea that inflation is necessary to sustain an economy is propaganda at best and straight up theft at its worst. If you zoom at max on the S&amp;P 500, the chart looks eerily similar to the currency collapse of the Weimar Republic.

All of this leads me to Bitcoin. The completely sovereign, most secure computer network designed for one purpose alone; to defend your hard earned money from all the bullshit.

I need some help.
I want to gift a symbolic amount of bitcoin to my niece for her first birthday. Something that should last at least 10 years with no maintenance. The final solution should also be something intuitive to access for anyone with some knowledge of bitcoin, as I might not be around in 10 or 20 years.
I want it to be a nice present as well, so I bought a cryptochips.io bitcoin coin with a blank square on the backside. 
My initial idea was to generate a bip-39 seed phrase, encode it in a qr code and have it laser-printed on the back of the coin.
As I don't have a laser printer for metal, I thought that I could add a passphrase to the mnemonic before generating the receiving address and send my bitcoin. This  would prevent the laser workshop to possibly steal my bitcoin.
The passphrase could be something simple to remember as name/date of birth of my niece

However I found that
1. Seedsigner does not generate a standardized qr code for the seed phrase. The qr code it generates it's something custom for the seedsigner, it's not part of any bip protocol
2. No bitcoin wallet allows to scan a qr code for the 12 or 24 bip-39 words, and then add a passphrase.
3. No mobile wallet allow to experiment with testnet

Any suggestion on how I can gift bitcoin using this nice bitcoin coin I bought?

side note: when bitcoin was worth almost nothing I started mining bitcoin but not for long. Few days ago I found my old backups which contained a bitcoin wallet with (today) very big transactions but from 2014 when bitcoin actually was not worth more (In 2014 i couldn't afford 100BTC). My heart was exploding when I saw the transactions like 8BTC, 499BTC and so on. But the balance never changed from 0. I looked up the addresses in blockchain. info but there weren't any transactions either.

Has someone any idea what those transactions are? (I recovered other wallets and the balance was shown few seconds after importing). I actually don't know 100% why i backed up this wallet. Thought it was from the mining time but 2014 seems a bit late.

Online sportsbooks are huge now, and most accept bitcoin. Process: Deposit bitcoin, receive equal amount of dollars (value at time of deposit) in your account to bet with. When it comes time to withdraw, assuming you're also withdrawing in bitcoin, it will give you your account's dollar value equivalent worth of bitcoin (value at time of withdrawal)

So in essence, sportsbooks would want to take your bitcoin when its dollar value is lower (we need to send more bitcoin for the same x amount of dollars), and want to send you bitcoin when its dollar value is higher (less bitcoin for the same x amount of dollars)

Baseless Theory while smoking a J:  Sportsbooks will try their best to drop the price of bitcoin leading up to major sporting events (i.e. superbowl), and then try their best to raise the price of bitcoin afterwards, as to lower the amt of bitcoin they need to send out. Bitcoin's price has been declining a bit leading till today, so maybe pump starting after the game and leading into next week? 🤞🤞

While this came the day after a record high US CPI print, the reason for this divergence could be less to do with inflation, and more with risk sentiment. 

Bitcoin is becoming increasingly correlated with traditional “risky” assets, while gold has maintained its status as a “safe-have” investment. This would explain Friday’s price action, with BTC following equities lower, as tensions in Eastern Europe escalated and sparked risk-off sentiment in the market. While gold’s move higher helped cement its place as an inflation hedge, as well as a hedge against geopolitical tensions and volatility. 

This ultimately raises the question; Can bitcoin ever replace gold as a safe store of wealth, or will it continue to be traded as a risky asset?

I've been developing a Bitcoin indicator that combines price data and on-chain metrics to determine where we are in the market cycle, and whether Bitcoin might be over or underpriced.

It allows one to, for instance, know when a bottom might be close and so to DCA more aggressively, or when a top could be approaching, and so when to start taking profits.

The idea is for the indicator to be easy to understand and user-friendly. I'd like it to be useful not only for more serious traders and investors, but also for those that are now getting into Bitcoin and need an easy to use tool to help them make sound decisions.

I'm also working on other two metrics, one that warns of an incoming pullback and another one for market sentiment (check small bars on 2nd image). But they still need some improvement.

* CEO of Bitcoin - They do not know that there is no one ""in charge"" of bitcoin.
* Not Hack Proof - They say the NYC couple hacked bitcoin. And the government did not to long ago to recover stolen bitcoin. As if hacking exchanges and networks is the same thing.
* Shitcoins - zero understanding of what distinguishes bitcoin from shitcoins. Pre-mining, unlimited supply, proof of work/stake etc.

I realize that this is a long shot and let me preface this by saying that I know pretty much nothing about BTC, so please bear with me if I am not being 100% accurate and might use the wrong terminology:

In the early days of crypto and BTC (must have been around 2011/2012) my roommate at the time got really into it and always tried to convince me and a friend to get as invested (literally) as he did. Unfortunately for him, we were just not that interested and never really spent too much time learning about crypto currencies. Said friend however did eventually gift us a small amount of EUR in BTC within a Coinpunk.com crypto wallet – his last desperate attempt to pull us into the BTC game. I don't remember exactly, but it must have been something between 5 and 20 EUR.

Anyways, long story short: I must admit that I never thought about it ever again until I recently randomly found my old Coinpunk login information (email and a password). I wanted to check it out, but quickly saw that Coinpunk was down and not operating anymore. I did some research as to find out what had happened, but no luck here really. Other than learning that the site is pretty much dead and has been for years.

tl;dr: Does anybody know if there is a way to still access my Coinpunk wallet and potentially somehow recover those 10 year old BTC?

Highlights:


&gt; **No, Bitcoin Ownership is not Highly Concentrated** 

&gt; 1. Not all Bitcoin addresses should be treated equal. For instance, an exchange address holding the funds from millions of users needs to be distinguished from an individual's self-custody address.
&gt; 
&gt; 2. A Bitcoin address is not an ""account"". One user can control multiple addresses, and one address can hold the funds from multiple users.

I have tried Coinbase and Gemini and they have a 5-7 day holding or cooling off period after purchase until the time you can send or trade it. I have set up FTX and Binance and others and they work with credit and debit cards but they are limited in that you can only purchase small amounts of $5-10k USD at a time and their fees are outrageously high, like 5% or so.

i like a service like pocketbitcoin as it is kind of cool in that you can wire them money and they keep your bitcoin wallet address on file and immediately credit your btc wallet address with btc upon receipt of the bank transfer and fees are only 1.5% but they only work with EUR or CHF and only with IBAN/SEPA Europe based accounts.

I want to talk about equitability and trust. First, is bitcoin equitable? Considering its historical (past and recent) events with money laundering; this is evidence to how equitable (fair and impartial) bitcoin is. People try to launder bitcoin just like how they would've laundered fiat (e.g., USD). But you can't because of its transparency. Eventually, you'll be caught and there's just no way around it. It's built in. It use to be that people of power can launder money in the dark. It would be hard to find unless there's some whistleblower. So those who had the means to ensure they can launder money secretly, could actually hide it from the public. And those who didn't have the means to would eventually get caught. So here, there are 3 problems. One, it's just wrong to launder money. Two, the ability to is greater for those who had power. And three, those who are most likely to get caught and be punished are those who had little means to hide the process.

Bitcoin says fuck all of that. It doesn't care about your power, it's amoral as such a system should be, and if you try to steal bitcoin, you'll get caught no matter what. That's why it's the most equitable monetary system.

Now trust. We often say it's a trustless system - you don't need a middle man. But I say it's the most trustworthy system because you don't need a middle man, along with everything else that's been said. If you want trust in your financial and economic system, this is the closest thing to it.

2022-02-16 11:03:43,"This is how many people it would take to buy bitcoin on Strike hourly before the amount of bitcoin mined per day were to be completely consumed. Assuming the current block size of 6.25 bitcoin every 10 minutes Just curious, its a numbers game, so how many people buying 50 cents of bitcoin every hour would it take before the amount of bitcoin mined per day was completely purchased?

Simple numbers game. Lets assume the current price of bitcoin is 44k, a 50 cent purchase is roughly 1135 satoshis. 

That means, 88 thousand people buying bitcoin hourly would purchase one full bitcoin from Strike, and 24 per day. Thats roughly 720 per month and 8,760 per year. 

The current amount of bitcoin mined per day is roughly 900, assuming the block size of 6.25 bitcoins is added every 10 minutes. Assuming the price remains the same it would roughly take 3.3 million people buying 50 cents hourly on strike to deplete the current amount of bitcoin mined per day.

88,000 x .50 = 44k

44k = one bitcoin 

3.3 million purchases per hour x .50 = $1,672,000 of bitcoin purchased per hour

1,672,000 / 44,000 = 38 bitcoin per hour purchased per hour

38 bitcoin x 24 hours = 912 bitcoin per day

This is a simple numbers game and granted Strike doesn't receive all the bitcoin mined per day. I wonder how much bitcoin strike really has in their reserves and if this is why they limit the amount you can buy.

Furthermore, this goes to show that shit could get parabolic if mass adoption occurs and that bitcoin is scarce as fuck. 3.3 million people may seem like a lot, but what if that many people started purchasing 50 cents of bitcoin per hour? That's roughly 12 dollars per day and 360 dollars per month...",-0.9998619556427002,0.0019230769230769195,0.43420329670329677,0.016,0.047,0.937,-0.7202

**Introduction**

I understand that many people think any government measures to expel the truckers from Ottawa are justified. I don’t want to try to persuade you otherwise. This post is for people who already believe that voluntary financial transactions should not be blocked or censored.

Assume the following:

1) One of the Trudeau government’s strategies is to starve the truckers out of Ottawa

2) The government can identify most of them just by observing their license plates

3) All financial accounts and debit/credit cards of the people identified will be frozen

4) Cops will set up road blocks at roads entering Ottawa

5) Vehicles big enough to carry large amounts of food and water will be searched and excessive food will be confiscated

**How can bitcoin be used to get spendable money to the truckers in Ottawa? Here is one way:** 

**Getting bitcoin to truckers**

1) Send bitcoin to trusted trucker organizers. One way is: [https://tallyco.in/honkhonkhodl/](https://tallyco.in/honkhonkhodl/)

The organizers discuss this fund here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ciUiOnVLM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ciUiOnVLM)

2) Truckers install a mobile bitcoin wallet on their phones

3) Organizer distributes bitcoin to individual truckers’ wallets

**How can truckers spend crypto for food/fuel etc.**

1) Persuade stores to accept crypto directly

2) If food trucks are permitted to enter Ottawa, they could accept crypto directly. 

3) Truckers buy whatever gift cards they need using crypto. The gift cards are sent to their phones and the truckers use the numerical code or a scannable QR code at the retail outlet to spend the gift card for food, fuel, etc. Currently you can buy many different kinds of gift cards at bitrefill.com using crypto with only an email address and without doing KYC. But what do you do if access to Bitrefill is blocked for Canadians or if Bitrefill is forced/pressured to implement KYC? 

4) There are a lot of people who would like to obtain crypto without having to go through a KYC exchange. Local crypto traders could go to Ottawa in person and offer to buy crypto for cash.

**Other Factors**

1) Are there stores in Ottawa that will accept crypto directly? This would greatly simplify the problem.

2) How tightly will the protest area be cordoned off by police

 **What are** Bitcoin **cycles and why is it so important❓**  
🚀This graph shows the entire history of Bitcoin, approximately 13 years. If you open the logarithmic display of the chart, you can see some patterns in price behavior. Namely, that Bitcoin moves in cycles. Which in turn are divided into an uptrend and a downtrend.  


🎢Three complete cycles can be clearly seen on the chart. One cycle lasts four years on average. Of which 2.5 years of growth, and 1.5 years of decline. At the same time we would like to note that the cycles expand over time. But with the arrival of big money, institutional investors and various global companies, this pattern will be less and less noticeable (like the example of the S&amp;P 500).  


**Why is** Bitcoin **cyclical❓**  
The answer is actually very simple. It is only noticeable because Bitcoin is in its early stage of development and acceptance. There are cycles in everything, it is a natural phenomenon.  


🔋As examples:  
\- World cycles, every 10 to 12 years there is a crisis followed by a renewal and continued growth;  
\- Natural cycles, many examples of how the environment develops and renews;  
\- Our well-being, sometimes you have noticed that your mood and energy is at its highest when you are very productive and feel good, and vice versa, when it is at its lowest and you are less productive.  


Markets are human creations, so they are also subject to natural behavior.  


**How can cycles help trading❓**  
✅Statistically, according to brokers and exchanges, 85-90% of traders are losing, 5-10% of traders are breaking even and only 5-7% of traders are earning. One of the most important tasks for any trader is to identify the right trend. Usually, when traders try to trade against the trend, they lose their trading accounts. That is why it is important to understand how to identify the trend and how to earn with the movement of the trend. This is where understanding Bitcoin cycles helps. Some of our trading systems are based on these principles.

2022-02-17 05:48:20,"Are the Masses ready for Bitcoin? This post was originally written for BitcoinNews.com. I thought I would share it here for posterity

It’s a beautiful Monday morning. After waking up, you drive to your favorite local coffee shop and order a delicious iced black coffee and a chocolate croissant. You wait patiently while the masked barista prepares your coffee, checking your Twitter account to pass the time. Upon opening the app, you realize your account has been suspended.

“Oh, crap! Have I violated any rules?” you ask yourself in disbelief. You’ve heard stories of accounts disappearing into thin air, but after all, you’ve never considered yourself anything close to a ‘radical’. You’re a life-long Democrat! What’s the deal?

“Sir! Your coffee is ready!”

The barista knocks you out of your dazed disbelief, and you move to the front of the counter to pay.

“That’ll be eight dollars.”

You reach into your pocket, fish out your wallet, and insert your debit card into the reader.

Declined.

“Hm, that’s strange. I know I have enough money in my account. Let me try again.” People are waiting anxiously in line behind you.

Three exhausting attempts later, you accept defeat. You make a mental note to call your bank and scrounge for that emergency cash you keep crumpled in the back of your wallet.

The barista gives you your change, and you go about your day.

On your drive home, you remember that you retweeted a meme that was ‘edgier’ than you would like to admit. “Was this the reason for the ban? No, Twitter wouldn’t suspend my account just because I retweeted a meme. That would be ridiculous.”

But it wouldn’t be ridiculous. It would be real.

Your life has fallen apart in slow motion. Your bank accounts were all shut down. After hours on hold, customer support explains that you’ve been labeled a ‘terrorist’ and therefore cannot access your funds.

It’s easy to laugh this story off, but unfortunately, this dystopian fiction is slowly becoming a reality for some people. Dissidents and protestors across the globe are starting to realize that their ‘money’ is not their money. The government can censor their finances at will, crippling their lives and shutting down their ability to speak out.

We don’t need privacy until we desperately need privacy. People are often quick to say, “Oh, that’ll never happen to me. They wouldn’t censor me. I’m an excellent citizen.”

They fail to understand that if it can happen to them, it will happen to them. Unless, of course, they decided to opt out of the traditional financial system.

We now live in a world where governments can turn off your bank account because of your political views. But the once-hidden power of the central banking cartel is becoming glaringly obvious. Few considered the vulnerability of their finances until they saw the grotesque display of totalitarian intervention in the fundraising efforts of the Canadian Freedom Convoy.

After witnessing such blatant government overreach, censorship resistance is now at the forefront of global consciousness. We are at a tipping point.

A distributed ledger was not enough. A global cash-final settlement network was not enough. An inflation hedge wasn’t enough, either.

Will uncensorable money be enough? Will the masses only realize the true value of Bitcoin after their bank accounts have been shut down? Or will they see what happened in Canada and opt-out preemptively?

The greatest evils often birth the greatest advancements. Each fundraiser that the government bans is a massive billboard for censorship-resistant money. The tyranny is obvious; the question is, are the masses ready for Bitcoin? Or must we spill blood in exchange for freedom once again?

My question is - in the same way that physical dollar bills have unique reference numbers, does each individual sat that I own have a unique reference number of some sort? And, if I buy a meal (say) using my Muun wallet, do those specifically referenced sats now change hands, or is it just that my amorphous blob of Bitcoin decreases by x sats, and the merchant’s amorphous blob increases by x?

2022-02-17 07:43:51,"The Economy of Bitcoin Mining, How it Will Tremendously Benefit Renewable Producers, Our Climate, and Might Make You Rich The problem:

Right now renewable energy sources have a problem, the rate in which they produce energy is sporadic often resulting in major gluts and inconsistent demand. Since the energy cannot be reliably stored, this results in what is called cycling, a plant having to shut down and restart production to suit the surrounding areas demand. Every time a power plant is turned off and on, the boiler, steam lines, turbine, and auxiliary components go through unavoidably large thermal and pressure stresses, which cause damage. This damage is made worse for high temperature components which will eventually start to fail, resulting in shorter component life expectancies which increase costs. If we want renewable energy sources to take market share from fossil fuels we need to find a way to reduce their prices to outcompete. 

Bitcoin fixes this?

This is where Bitcoin mining comes in. Bitcoin mining gives renewable energy companies reliable sources of income because Bitcoin mines can set up shop on site and act as buyers of last resort for the excess power generated and have virtually unlimited demand for excess meaning the plant won’t have to cycle or waste which is inefficient and costly. The reliable income from Bitcoin miners and virtually unlimited demand for excess gives power companies MORE money for expansion, R&amp;D , and most importantly lowers costs to the end consumer. 

The coming boon:

We have already seen this model working to great effect in Texas. Layer1, the largest US Bitcoin mine utilizing abundant wind energy buys excess power from the local renewable energy producers and mines Bitcoin, in times of high consumer demand in the surrounding areas the Bitcoin mine shuts or slows down, selling the energy it contractually purchased back to the grid acting like an insurance underwriter for producers. A harmony where both interests are met creating a huge boon in Texas renewable producers. Bitcoin miners are flocking to Texas allowing renewable producers to expand, making green energy more abundant. If you are a enterprising individual you would do well for yourself to find a way into this fledgeling market. 

Ultimately I predict Bitcoin will have the largest positive effect on renewable energy production, R+D and adoption in the coming decades. Bitcoin will do more for green energy in all forms than any industry, climate protest or politician combined utilizing game theoretic principles to achieve its ends. There are even more unique things happening in the Bitcoin mining world to look into, some Bitcoin mining companies are trapping flare gas that would’ve been exhausted into the atmosphere and using it to mine Bitcoin, for free.

Reasons why I'm right, and politics neutral people and the politically ignorant are wrong:

I'm a classical political anarchist, I've spent my life studying the government of Lenin, Stalin, and Hitler, I know what happened, and what led to it, I understand authoritarian extremist fringe modern current groups very well, and how they can bring heat down on crypto through guilt by association, and how the government can abuse this concern trolling like Trudeau is currently doing.

Conservatives are less hostile to bitcoin because some republican politicians are being open about it. The moment Trump or Tom Cotton tells them to be hostile towards it, they will be. Bill Barr, Mnunchin, and Trump and the entire Neocon establishment are and were hostile to bitcoin.

But we have a much bigger problem, the cultural zietgeist of progressives is deeply against the thesis and purpose of bitcoin. The liberal parties of western countries beleive there is always an excuse or reason for the government to intrude upon and violate not just the constitution but the very Thesis of Bitcoin itself;

They do not believe in the right to censorship resistence, confiscation resistence, and radical financial sovereignty and self custody, they want backdoors, and they want to violate your freedom of assembly, property, and speech, they are becoming radicalized and anti-liberal in the process. I consider them the ""Blue Stack"" a fascist merger of colluding government agencies, NGO, corporate press, and extreme tech conglomerates operating in sync to censor and depatform people.

Bitcoin cannot survive with one party, with only conservative parties, even if the average progressive is hardline opposed to the separation of the state and money, we must \*CO-OPT and Control The Liberal Parties of the West\* 

\*We Must Co-opt and Control The Liberal Parties Of The West\*

\*We Must Get anti-crypto Candidates Knocked Out of the Running, and Pro Bitcoin Pro Self-Custody Candidates Elected\*

The pandemic has hastened the transition to a cashless society. Customers adopted new digital payment habits in the years preceding up to it, such as a growing preference for contactless payments and online card payments. In Singapore, for example, less than one in every five Singaporeans now prefers cash to electronic payment choices.

The benefits of digital payment systems are aplenty, such as instant payments and increased security. Still, they can spell trouble for those without a bank account or the elderly population, most of whom rely on cash for everyday payments

There are numerous advantages to using digital payment methods, including fast payments and greater security. Even yet, they can cause problems for those without a bank account or the elderly, who rely on cash for most of their transactions.

Regardless, there is a growing body of evidence indicating that the globe is getting closer to near-universal use of e-wallets and electronic payments, with some reports claiming that by 2025, half of the world's population would be using mobile wallets.

With the Russia fears looming, we have seen large swings, and people are blaming fears of Russian invasion for being the cause, with some even warning that if they do invade, it would trigger a massive sell off. What I don't understand is why though.

Hello, is changing ones tax residency in order to reduce (to zero even) his INDIVIDUAL (not corporate) taxes really ""doable"" and ""passable""... IN REALITY (not(!) theory) ? Meaning - will my (home country) tax office really ""accept it"" (accept that i dont have to pay taxes  in my home country)...? Did somebody really DONE IT ALREADY IN PRACTISE and ""got away with it""...? OR even better- did a TON of people did it and did it worked for that TON of people...? In theory it should work, but does/will it really work IN THE REAL WORLD...?

I read somewhere that its the most discussed tax optimalization (everybody says ""i will do it someday"") but the LEAST (!) utilized one in reality (!)...

Im talking mainly about optimalization of ones (selling) crypto (bitcoin) taxes...? Do u actually know about somebody who did it in the past and actually DID GET AWAY with it already...? (his home country tax office ""let him be"")...?

Im currently in ""process"" of seriously thinking (well already preparing) to do so, but im not sure it will work (and i dont wanna waste my time (YEARS) in foreign country just for my home country to say (after the years) ""F\*ck you, we dont recognize that, pay taxes here""...

1) Do u know IN REALITY that changing tax residency (in order to take advantage of no tax) WORKED for anybody IN REALITY...? (crypto/bitcoin tax wise ideally...?)

&amp;#x200B;

My Case:

Im an European, looking to move to other European country that has lower crypto taxes (basically zero under some circumstances... so i should be able to pay actually ZERO taxes in my particular case)... im not sure my home country will like/accept it. I already had several consultations with my home country lawyers/tax advisors. The ammount (of money) is rather large... So Im seriously worried my home country wont accept it.

Im single (no girlfriend/wife or children). I have of course my ""original family"" (father, mother, uncle etc...) in my home country. I work over the internet (so not connected at all to my home country; i work for abroad). Im not from any really ""strict"" tax country (like UK for example), yet im still worried. I dont own any property in ANY country... Im planning to go to foreign country (still in the EU) for probably like 2-4 years...? (most likely something around 3 years(?))... Then i would like to move back to my home country...

My tax advisor said that there are several pitfalls in my case - i wouldnt have a family in my new country. And i would have my ""old/original"" family (father, mother etc.) still (of course) in my home country... Tax advisor said that this might seriously screw me... I might be able to find a girlfriend in the new country, but who knows... Is GF enough (GF is not a wife), will i find one (i dont speak the language etc.)... So not having family in the new country might seriously fu\*k me... Another thing - i wont have any ""real job"" there, i will be again self employed (as i am in my home country) and work for abroad... So i wont have any real ""job"" in the new country that would ""warrant me"" being there (i can work all over the world- any place)... Thats another pitfall that might screw me my tax advisor said... We even talked about finding some ""dumb"" regular job in the new county just to have one. Just to be able to say to my home country tax office - ""Look, i have to be there - in the new country, since i have a job there""...

These 2 issues (family (absence of that is), and the absence of ""regular"" job) are the 2 things that might thwart my efforts to have a tax residency in the new country (length of stay of 3 years is ok, but the 2 other things might fuc\* me over). Tax advisor said that i could be there even for 5 years and my home country tax office might still consider me a tax resident in my home country...

Two Questions:

1) Do u know IN REALITY that changing tax residency (in order to take advantage of no tax) WORKED for anybody IN REALITY...? (crypto/bitcoin tax wise ideally...?)

2) What do you think about my particular case...? (speak only if you know something about the issue please) Will it work for me...? Do i have strong enough case to succesfully defend my tax residency in new country in front of my home country tax office?",-0.9997976422309875,0.1100515922433731,0.43508006453211917,0.068,0.047,0.885,0.9644

I turn to your subreddit to post my naïve/noob question: how can a canadian trucker actually cash out donated bitcoin to purchase goods and services ?
Bitcoin is suppose to free us from government over-intervention and frozen bank accounts like it's happening now, so if they flag wallets, i assume truckers can't go to kraken or binance to cash out for USD or CAD right ?
and if they want to buy goods directly with bitcoin (assuming they find relailers doing this) then wouldn't retailer be also 'tagged' by government to have accepted btc from frozen wallet ?
In that scenario, i assume DEX is the go to solution, but as far as i know, no DEX has on/off-ramp to USD or CAD right now, and even if they did it would feed into truckers.. bank accounts which are also frozen.
so are we any different than legacy system if we are limited to a centralize bottleneck for paying goods and services legally in a sovereign nation which decides it's not ok anymore ?

Also, doesn't that mean that as humanity as a whole adds more value to the world, every BTC holder benefits from that too because all value will be shoveled into BTC?

In other words, instead of only the companies benefitting from new inventions, both the companies AND the people of the world benefit because we all hold finite units of a protocol that will eventually symbolize all of the world's value. Right? 

As the world gets more valuable, every single person's finances grow as well.

In the podcast, Peter McCormack's mind is blown and he talks about connecting Troy with people in the community. Excited to see if Fidelity, which has been surprisingly pro-Bitcoin, or any other financial institution, sees the value in this idea for this financial product (referenced in the whitepaper as a ""Green Co-Investment Instrument"" or ""GCI"") down the road. This would make it instantly possible for you to figure out what amount of green mining would be needed to offset your own holdings, and then without having to do any mining yourself, you could invest however much you need to into the GCI in order to be carbon neutral (or better).  


Big implications for the financial industry if this sort of product is built and adopted. Even without the financial instrument being created, if this idea of green mining to offset carbon impact of Bitcoin holdings catches on within the ESG community, it could have massive impacts to adoption at an institutional level. This is the exact sort of idea/realization that properly aligns incentives to create win-wins for everyone -- something every Bitcoiner likely can appreciate given how the network itself already aligns incentives all over the place so spectacularly.",0.9966875910758972,-0.01091269841269841,0.4451388888888888,0.09,0.0,0.91,0.9563

I love what this community stands for. I think it's the greatest invention since the internet. But, let's be real for a minute: will we ever have *genuine* decentralization if crypto exchanges continue to share users' data with the US government?

Don't be so naive. The United States wants their taxes; they always have. The exchanges are looking to earn money and grow their costumer base. The exchanges recognize that in order to get there, they must compete to stay on the good side of the government; otherwise, there could very well be an immediate market ban on their company.   
So, what are they going to do? They require identification verification. Why? Because the government wants all the leverage.   
If one day a government agency claims that individual X did not pay their full share of taxes or is under investigation for A, B, or C, there is no doubt in my mind that the exchange would refuse to comply with the government. Boom: all your bitcoin confiscated. Then what?   
My humble gentle reminder: US crypto exchanges don’t give a shit about individuals. They're here to earn money; even if it means competing who can suck Uncle Sam off the longest.

[\(Art created by Longque Chen\) ](https://preview.redd.it/2rqr1ddoqpi81.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f017033b768d872a75e11d354788dc22263f3bff)

""Bitcoin fixes this"" is a phrase that gets thrown around quite often. I will admit bitcoin does not fix everything neither does it intend to. What it does 'best' is why it is a solution to many issues. A decentralized immutable global monetary network secured by the consensus.

Recently we saw GoFundMe censor user's funds being sent to the cause of their choice! Over $8m of funds were withheld from being donated and now users are given until Feb 19th to request a refund. At first hand we are seeing centralized organizations censor user's funds. 

In retaliation to the censored funds, we saw protesters organize donations to be sent via Tallycoin app which is built on top of the bitcoin network. Donators had the ability to send satoshi's through an immutable network knowing first hand they will not be censored 

The Canadian Government's dystopian response to this was to freeze funds of all connected users for both currencies and digital assets. this kind of widespread censorship to tax-paying citizens is that of an authoritarian response, but don't forget, this could happen anywhere. 

[\(If you're not familiar, Referring to the authoritarian regime from \\""V For Vendetta\)](https://preview.redd.it/6s4libv4rpi81.png?width=726&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=174640f93d56ac91811f29a25edbf52e95345df1)

Societies are highly complex in their structure but at the foundation of all societies are hard working individuals. One would assume individuals would be able to spend their money as they see fit, sadly this is not the case in the world we live in. Not in it's current state. 

Questions are now arising such as 

""What are true property rights?"" 

""How do we combat censorship?""

""Why can't they stop bitcoin transactions?"" 

""If I'm not in control who is?""

""What is money?"" 

These are the questions that eventually lead one to Bitcoin.

One of Bitcoin's most crucial utilities comes from it's design. It is truly decentralized which makes it both highly secure and highly immutable due to their not being a central authority to make all the decisions. These 'decisions' are engraved in code. 

These 'decisions' are written in code only to be executed when predefined conditions are met, this allows for full inclusivity to a global monetary network. This allows an honest network where users can stay fully anonymous, all due to trust guarantees not trust assumptions. 

I think it's about time people start waking up to the philosophical aspect of bitcoin which leads to quite a paradigm shift in thought. No longer are we forced to trust third parties, governments, and central banks. We now have an immutable global network at our disposal.

2022-02-19 13:03:06,"Governments realizing they're too late to exert control over Bitcoin They smiled and laughed at it when it was young and fragile. Obama laughed it off and presided over bank bailouts and the creation of BTC. Trump was too stupid to understand it and praises the USD. Hillary is smart enough to realize it can demonetize the political class which her meaning is dependent upon, so praises the USD. Biden is an old clown that realizes it can interfere with his legacy and makes his money printing ambitions too obvious--a sin he'd like to remain in the shadows.

Unfortunately for the Cantillionaires, 90% of all bitcoin has already been mined, the majority of which is in the hands of individuals like you and I. The last 10% will take over 100 years to mine, the majority of which will wind up in the hands of individuals (yes individuals), companies, and governments that are all mining right now. The reason for this is simple: exponential deflation. The BTC inflation adjustment happens every 4 years (every 210k blocks) and is called the halving, where the coinbase (block reward) halves. It's currently 6.25 BTC per block. That means in 2024, it'll take 3-5 times the investment of what it costs currently, to make the same amount of BTC now, because of:

* halving
* average hashpower increase
* increasing informational scarcity per transaction

So the only way governments can acquire it more or less is the same way they acquired gold: confiscation schemes. That's why the clowns of Bitfinex hack fame who kept 2000 unencrypted seeds in the cloud are detrimental; it's why people that keep their coins on exchanges are fools; it's why anybody that trades bitcoin (especially with leverage) is a gambling junkie masquerading as an investor; it's why civil forfeiture and three-letter agencies are developing crypto-specific enforcement groups. This is how they plan on funding they're future surveillance and enforcement apparati. Governments can't print to acquire bitcoin anymore because that would moon the price of BTC and inadvertently put even more pressure on their central banks and require exponential printing; as BTC is the most free market and hard asset in mankind's 200k year history, it will margin call and suck the value of everything pegged to, or purchasable by it. So realistically, only one or two nation states could dump their gold on the open market for BTC before the price of gold cratered and is demonetized down to its utility value. Hedging to the downside wouldn't even work because gold derivative premiums would put a green candle through heaven's floorboards. Game theory would favor the first 1-2 movers (sellers) there, before irreparably damaging the 99% of the countries foolish enough to hold it.",-0.9994893074035645,0.05097597597597597,0.4475117975117976,0.099,0.07,0.83,0.9448

1) your money isn’t on your phone or a “flash drive.”

2) the blockchain is your bank and your phone/thumb drive is your wallet just like the leather one in your pocket. 

3) you can take all your cash out of the bank and put in your wallet but if you lose you cash or you are robbed you shit out of luck.

4) if you lose your phone or thumb drive, you just get a new one and put in your seed phrase. Your digital cash is waiting for you. And there will be ways to convert BTC to dollars if needed.

5) you can send that btc to Pete’ farm up the road and no one or government can stop you. It will cost you a few cents.

6) a satellite phone could work even if you lose internet. 

7) if the internet goes down world wide you are gonna need bullets more than anything. But, there are copies of the block chain in space. You money will be always waiting.

8) you could be stripped naked and thrown in prison or leave your house with nothing - if you memorize your seed, you carry BTC in your head.

8) They will only ever be 21M

He has always talked about how he’d love to Bitcoin mine on a small scale. Around December, I told him we should do it. Our current home would sell for a great price, we’d move to a state with the best energy rates (Arkansas is our choice). We’re going to buy a much less expensive home with land, pay for it almost in full with the equity from our current home and buy 11-12 machines to start with the remaining equity.

We’ve already calculated everything - the energy costs in the area we’re purchasing in and how much profit we’d make as well. We wouldn’t be living luxuriously, especially with two young children, but it would be enough to pay the bills and my husband to not need to work anymore.

It is a revolutionary decentralised form of digital money that delivers to you direct custody and control of a token that can be exchanged with others who accept it without any government or banker intermediaries.

It is an alternative to the fiat debt based state monopoly franchised to private bankers that the dollar and other state fiat currencies are.

For the above Bitcoin is a challenge to state power and bankers profits and power.

Only invest in Bitcoin if you understand and accept you are investing in a revolution. Only invest if you want to be part of that revolution and can accept the risks inherent in this.

Do not invest in Bitcoin if all you seek is more fiat money wealth. Understand this is a risky investment with no guarantees and only makes sense if you wish to be part of a global protest and revolution seeking to free yourself and others from the tyranny of state monopolist fiat debt slavery.

Well folks, here's the thing....people are entitled to voice their opinion. I am not necessarily saying it's right or wrong but what surprises me the most is when people treat Bitcoin like stocks and panic sell when there are protests or tensions across nations. 

If anyone has forgotten, just wanted to reiterate here that, Bitcoin symbolizes ""decentralization and financial freedom"" and it's very essence of creation by Satoshi is to hold your BTC and believe in it in times like these. 

Stop treating BTC like stocks or gold. Can we just call ""Bitcoin"" as ""Bitcoin"" rather than saying digital gold or alternative form of currency etc?

It's time to buy and hold your coins if you feel Bitcoin is a potential hedge against inflation. 

The very reason why Warren Buffet or Charlie Munger are still able to scaremonger is because of panic sellers and weak hands in the market who truly don't understand the value of Bitcoin and do emotional trading. This gives more power to politicians and rich businessmen who strongly believe in centralization and control your finances. 

Next time think twice before selling your coins. Learn to hold your coins and stop trading your coins with emotions.

As every crypto currency wants to have it's own purpose, Bitcoin wants to be digital gold or that's what most people in the crypto world think of it.

They see this as a goal in the far future but I think if you just give it a thought, bitcoin is kind of like digital gold already. I don't mean this in terms of stability as gold is seen as a conservative investment strategy but more like the status of gold. No one can replicate gold and it is kind of a big thing when someone tells you that ""That watch/ring is made out of gold"". 

I had the exact same feeling when a good friend told me that her best friend has some Bitcoin. 

There is a difference between saying "" I have 50.000$ on my bank account just laying around"" and ""I have a bitcoin in my wallet"".

Also: People like to put Gold is a Safe and just store it there. I feel like putting BTC on a Cold wallet just gives off the same vibe.

&gt; California’s new bill proposes to make Bitcoin a legal tender
&gt; FEBRUARY 20, 2022 BY LIPIKA DEKA
&gt; 
&gt; Political advisors in California are working on a new bill that aims to make Bitcoin a legal tender in the state. Former Majority Leader of the California State Assembly who is now a Political advisor Ian C. Calderon tweeted that he is working in collaboration with Bitcoin expert Dennis Porter to draft the new proposal.
&gt; 
&gt; The news comes close on the heels of previously reported Arizona and the Island of Tonga expressing similar intentions to legalize the king coin. Looks like the California bill is set to disrupt the legal tender race once again.
&gt; 
&gt; The U.S state recently hit the headlines when at a Congressional hearing politician Brad Sherman compared crypto to sub-prime mortgages and asked a Treasury Department official if “those of color will be left holding the bag if we see a collapse in cryptocurrency or stablecoins?”
&gt; 
&gt; His comments invited a barrage of tweets including Ryan Selkis of Messari who accused Sherman of making it a racial issue while refusing to debate his pro-crypto primary challenger Aarika Rhodes, who happens to be Black.
&gt; 
&gt; Aarika Rhodes, the U.S. congressional candidate for California’s 32nd District is looking to unseat Congressman Brad Sherman [D-Calif.], who termed bitcoin as “a way for economic justice.” “Do I love the Lightning Network? Absolutely, I think it is the future,” Rhodes said.

&gt; With respect to BTC adoption in the state, crypto advocates believe that it would most likely catapult straight into hyperbitcoinization.

2022-02-21 02:47:35,"A circular bitcoin economy - Fountain Podcasts and the value for value model I really enjoyed the movement to fund the trucker convoy using bitcoin, allowing donations to go directly to the protesters, but the whole thing showed us that we have not built out the ecosystem to use bitcoin the way it was meant. The bitcoin economy is still very reliant on the fiat on and off ramps. Bitcoiners need to work towards a circular economy where you don't buy bitcoin, you get paid in bitcoin, and you don't sell bitcoin you trade goods and services for it. Looking for opportunities to move towards the circular bitcoin economy I came across a great podcast app called Fountain. 

Fountain Podcasts works just like any other podcast app but it has integrated a lightning wallet. When content producers claim their podcast on Fountain, they can link a lightning node and listeners can stream bitcoin to them while they stream content to their listeners. This is the value for value model that bitcoiners should be looking for. Where content producers can cut out any middleman and consumers can support the content they like directly with as little as 1 sat/min. 

Right now there are mostly bitcoin podcasts that have the lightning feature enabled but anyone producing a podcast can claim their content and start receiving sats. I think we should start to encourage content producers to switch to a value for value model with bitcoin. I have reached out to some producers to let them know that I want to support them with bitcoin but they haven't claimed their content in Fountain yet. Hopefully they will see the value in being funded directly from their listeners with no 3rd party able to disrupt their ability to produce and share content. Especially with all the censorship and banning going on these days.

Its now becoming clear that corporate news outlets are losing their monopoly on information and becoming more desperate to eliminate competition. Even worse, governments have been helping legacy media censor and ban their competitors. They do this by going after their competitors ability to finance their content, usually by getting advertisers to pull support. Switching to a value for value model ensures the content you support doesn't go away, but it's important to have that system in place when/if producers you support get cut off from funding. We must start moving to this value for value model now, so we do not have another situation like with the trucker convoy. We want to be leading the charge against fiat and all its corruption, not simply just reacting to it and hoping it all works out.

At the very least switch to Fountain simply to get away from big tech companies like Apple, Google, Spotify or other platforms that are pro censorship. Let producers know you want to support them directly and let's start making a ture circular bitcoin economy.

Was heading home from a little road trip and had to stop around about 2 hours away from home for gas. Had the wife and kids with me. Went to fill up and my cards keep getting declined. Try to call the bank and they had froze my accounts due to ""suspected fraudulent activity"" and said there was nothing they could do for 24 hours. 

No way to access any of my money and didn't have enough gas to make it home. Was starting to get a little nervous. Then I remembered I had some money in bitcoin. I was able to find a crypto atm (didn't even know those existed) within a quarter mile that I walked to. At this atm, I was able to sell some of my bitcoin and withdraw cash from the atm, which I was then able to use to buy gas to get home. 

Insanely lucky I had funds that were practical/useful when my bank was not accessible. And thus I realized the true benefit of Bitcoin. 

Just wanted to share, as I've never seen, firsthand, the practical use of crypto currency before. Here was a situation where I was unable to access a resource through a ""respected"" financial institution, but i was able to access and utilize crypto currency.

For example, when the US announced the greater than expected CPI the stock market tanked, and BTC followed it lock step. I’m assuming something just happened with Russia (6:30am EST) because both BTC and the stock market futures sharply declined, again in lock step.

2022-02-21 19:16:30,"Question about Bitcoin Adoption Hello all

I am very bullish on btc, and a long term HODLer, I do however have a question I ask myself every day that does slightly eat me up and I was wandering if any of you guys had any counter points to my question:

BTC deserves a place in a society, the advantageous of it are huge, it closes the gap between the rich and poor, it generally docent care who you are that possess it, only important thing is that you OWN some btc. (I could talk about its pros all day but id be here forever lol)

Seeing as mass adoption of btc would put the banks out of business, and take ALOT of controlling power away from the big fish and the governments, I ask myself everyday the same question:

Why would they allow this?

Banks, Governments and HUGE corps have the power, capital and influence to manipulate and control pretty much everything. Sure BTC is decentralised,. but I'm sure their are ways they could soil BTCs growth; one way would be through the media, btc could be the best thing ever for everyone but if the media advertises it as a scam and people \*who do historically just follow whatever they see from major news outlets\* buy into this, then their is one huge fork In the road for mass adoption.

I really want btc to do well, I think it would improve quality of life for everyone, and anyone calling it useless really isn't educated in the technology. I just can't wrap my head around why the big boys would allow their power and money to be diminished by btc mass adoption.

Thanks all and have a great day, sorry if my English is bad, I'm not very good at articulating what I'm thinking.",-0.9997791647911072,0.1439879564879565,0.5302318052318052,0.166,0.057,0.777,0.9883

2022-02-22 01:15:26,"Why Kraken is the most underrated Bitcoin exchange After many years of using different Bitcoin exchanges I just want to outline why Kraken is the most underrated exchange and why it is superior to Coinbase and Binance (in my opinion). 

1) Customer support: Have you ever tried to reach the customer support of Coinbase or Binance? It's horrible. Your funds got stuck? You can't verify? Got hacked? Lost 2FA? Good luck getting help from those two 'major' exchanges. Kraken customer support is there to help you, they are even active here on reddit and reach out to you without being asked for help. Love that service!

2) Fees: Especially for those who trade, deposit and withdraw often, fees are a major topic. Coinbase has super low withdrawal fees but quite high trading fees. Binance withdrawal fees are horrible but their trading fees are low. Kraken is a bit more expensive than Binance but their withdrawal fees are lower. To me, it's a very good tradeoff between those two major fees.

3) UI/UX: This point is more subjective than objective. Kraken had an old fashioned appearance for quite a long time. But this has changed a lot and navigating through their website is far easier compared to their competitors. They also provide a very decent App which is easy to use and still has good features.

4) Lightning integration: Okay, non of those exchanges I mentioned so far has integrated LN afaik. But Kraken seems to be the most progressive when it comes to LN integration. They announced that users will be able to use LN in 2021. Well, it's 2022 now... Let's see what's going to happen this year. Shout out to Coincorner. 

5) Blocksize war: Don't know much about this topic. All I know is that Coinbase played a major role in pushing BCH...?

2022-02-22 03:45:50,"Bitcoin minors exempt from IRS reporting rules: US Treasury Addresses miner concerns On January 26, 2022, eleven US representatives wrote to US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen in response to the Infrastructure Investment in Jobs Act’s definition of a “broker”, which they claimed was not fairly applicable to the nature of work carried out in the crypto industry. 

The Broadly Defined “Broker” 

The Act outlined that brokers would be required to collect detailed information about their customers and their trades, with those participating in crypto and the blockchain network included in the “broker” definition. It would have imposed unnecessary tax reporting burdens on crypto miners and stakers who don’t usually deal directly with their customers and do not have ready access to such information. 

Crypto Miners and Stakers To Be Exempt 

The US Treasury Department has since addressed these concerns, and on February 11, 2022 responded with a letter that indicated crypto miners and stakers will not be subject to the tax reporting requirements that will be implemented on exchanges. 

The Treasury implied that the requirements would pertain only to those who already have access to and use such detailed customer information: “Existing regulations impose broker reporting obligations only on market participants engaged in business activities that provide them with access to information about sales of securities by taxpayers.” 

The letter, written by Jonathan Davidson, an assistant Treasury secretary for legislative affairs, further clarified that “ancillary parties who cannot get access to information that is useful to the IRS (Internal Revenue Service) are not intended to be captured by the reporting requirements for brokers.” 

This clarification comes as a relief to active members in the crypto industry, considering that an overly broad definition could be impossible for many participants to act in accordance with. 

Proposed Regulations and Next Steps 

The U.S. Treasury Department plans to issue additional proposed regulations that will reflect how a broker is defined. This issuance will follow a rulemaking process similar to those followed for other regulations that are implemented at the federal level. 

The crypto industry collectively made its concerns surrounding the Infrastructure Investment in Jobs Act’s broker definition heard, and these concerns were thus acknowledged and acted on. There are significant implications to be drawn here, pertaining to the role and presence of crypto actors becoming legitimized for future legislative decisions, especially when it comes to crypto activity. 

As Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies continue to forge a path to acceptance, members of the crypto community can better equip themselves to keep up with the momentum that will follow (and stimulate the momentum of their own operations) by engaging crypto mining services provided by industry experts such as Wattum.

Why is it depression hits you harder with Bitcoin then fiat when losing it?

Is it because you know it's stuck in the wallet and haunting you? or is it because with fiat you know someone will pick it up and use it. So it's like sharing your money and won't go to waste.

This is not trivial, because the same cannot be said about any medium of exchange where control over the supply is centralized to decisions made by the few. 

For a real example, take $1 million USD when compared to the [M2 USD Supply](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL):

United States Dollar (M2 supply):
1962: $1 million = 1/343,100th of the M2 USD supply
1972: $1 million = 1/738,400th of the M2 USD supply
1982: $1 million = 1/1,869,700th of the M2 USD supply
1992: $1 million = 1/3,399,700th of the M2 USD supply
2002: $1 million = 1/5,520,600th of the M2 USD supply
2012: $1 million = 1/10,319,800th of the M2 USD supply
2022: $1 million = 1/21,638,100th of the M2 USD supply

As you can see, $1 million USD is already less than 1/21 millionth of the M2 USD supply.  And descent does not seem to be slowing.",-0.6834444403648376,-0.022222222222222216,0.14305555555555557,0.022,0.0,0.978,0.4356

2022-02-23 05:43:19,"How can Bitcoin currently be used in a country like Canada? As a Canadian, I've been following the Freedom Convoy closely. It's made me have serious doubts about the utility and use case of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. We've been parroting this idea that Bitcoin is a completely rogue financial asset that cannot be confiscated and that exists outside of the financial system. During times of war, economic meltdown, or government tyranny, Bitcoin can be sent to and from peers.

But the Freedom Convoy proved that isn't true. The Canadian government was able to force financial institutions to freeze the accounts of those associated with the Convoy, even those who contributed only small sums to the cause. Sure, you could send BTC to the protesters in Ottawa, but they couldn't do anything with it. If you're a protester and you tried to sell your BTC and deposit it into your bank account, the transaction won't go through since your account is frozen. This disproves one of Bitcoin's biggest use cases. Sovereign governments can still stop individuals from realizing the material benefit of their crypto holdings simply by severing the connection between an individual's fiat and crypto financial accounts. Since you cannot buy groceries, gasoline, legal represenation, and other necessities with BTC, crypto holders must convert their holdings, which can be made impossible by sovereign state actors.

Can anyone refute this?

Automated Translation:

Cramming crypto regulation. The European Parliament wants to prohibit the provision of crypto services based on ""environmentally unsustainable consensus mechanisms"" in its MiCA guidelines. This is according to a final compromise proposal from the responsible Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON), which is available to BTC-ECHO. De facto, this could mean the end for proof-of-work-based cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin from January 1, 2025 in the European Union. The final decision on the draft is to be made in Parliament on February 28.

Stefan Berger told BTC-ECHO that he believes it is ""very likely"" that the proposal will go through. As Chairman of the ECON Committee, he is largely responsible for the design of the MiCA Directive on the regulation of cryptocurrencies in the European Parliament. The advance of the Bitcoin ban had thereby the SPD, Greens and Left energetically demanded, said the CDU politician in an interview with BTC-ECHO.

The parliamentary groups of the Christian Democrats, right-wing conservatives and liberals would have vehemently resisted the inclusion of the ban in the negotiations. In the end, the Social Democrats, Greens and Left threatened to otherwise withhold their approval of the MiCA draft, according to reports. Previously, SPD politician Joachim Schuster had already publicly called for a bitcoin ban. Green Party European politician Sven Giegold also spoke to BTC-ECHO in favor of illegalization.

The vote next Monday will be followed by a trilogue between the EU Commission, the Parliament and the member states, at the end of which the Commission will be tasked with evaluating the Parliament's proposal. The decision on this should be expected before the end of this year. In the October 2020 draft, the Commission opposed a bitcoin ban.

Bitcoin clause is ""fatal""

Federal Finance Minister Christian Lindner did not want to comment on the impending bitcoin ban to BTC-ECHO. Frank Schäffler (FDP), member of the Budget Committee of the Bundestag, considers the new proposal of the EU Parliament ""fatal"". He already called for changes to the MiCA guidelines last year.

I assume and also expect that the German government and the lead finance minister Christian Lindner will prevent this.

Robert Kopic of the industry association Blockchain for Europe also sees the potential for the clause to ""put Europe at a disadvantage.""

This is a point that would put Europe, along with its green miners, at a disadvantage and would solely lead to them migrating abroad and Europe losing geopolitical access to Bitcoin.

The economic disadvantages of a Bitcoin ban are therefore obvious. A fact that the EU Commission will also take into account in its MiCA assessment, says Stefan Berger. What the final decision will ultimately look like is uncertain at this point.",-0.9998273253440857,-0.004556277056277057,0.3431060606060606,0.043,0.098,0.858,-0.982

I'm sure we've all seen the talk amongst the Bitcoin community online within the past several weeks regarding recommendations to buy non-KYC corn, use coinjoin, run your own node, increase your privacy etc. 

While I definitely understand the sentiment, as an American citizen I feel we'd have way bigger problems on our hands if the American government or certain financial institutions were to freeze off/on ramps or if they were to try to limit and or restrict purchasing Bitcoin and prevent us from moving our funds around. I don't know how Canada is, but here in the states we have plenty of pro-Bitcoin politicians, so shit would really have to hit the fan in order for the state to impose such actions on its citizens. 

I've also seen/heard the possibility of the American government implementing executive order 6102, but once more IMO we would have far bigger problems on our hands if something like that were to happen. Plus if you custody your BTC in cold storage what are they gonna do arrest every single citizen that bought KYC and throw them in jail if they don't comply? I mean hell good luck with that. 

I'm also aware of the general consensus of not giving in to and further funding the state through taxation on Bitcoin etc, but I don't think its realistic to think that the majority of Bitcoin buyers have the technical know how to go about maximizing their privacy and leaving little to no trace on the blockchain for their purchases, I know I don't.

2022-02-24 06:56:20,"Buying ""private"" Bitcoin Hello! I'm still new to buying Bitcoin and I need some help from you.
Especially with the gov slowly pushing to regulate Bitcoin more, I think that if there's a time to buy (for me personally), it's now. 
I already made some plans. I want to buy real coins. However here in Germany, crypto is regulated in a way that you can't really buy it anonymously anymore. Every way to buy Bitcoin via an exchange requires me to provide a full set of data. (I know about the ATMs but I don't like those for the high margins they take). 

My current plan is to sign up at an exchange, and transfer the money to an ""independent"" wallet of mine. 

My question is:
Should I use something like a coinjoin? 

My process of thought is the following:
The money doesn't have to be 100% private, that's not my goal. However I want it to be independent. I want it to be my own, no matter which new law might come in place. The problem I am now thinking of is: what if for some fucked up reason crypto will be deemed illegal some time in the future. Then the officials are able to request the information about me from the exchange and trace back to the wallet my money is stored in. Am I correct with this? If so, it might be a good idea to use a coinjoin. They might conclude that the money is out there, but not where. Correct? 

So what I am asking is:
Should I use something like this or is it too much/inappropriate in my situation?",-0.998767614364624,0.09055335968379444,0.42387351778656124,0.054,0.066,0.88,-0.8089

We come to warn you of the destiny of your race and your world so that you may communicate to your fellow beings the course you must take to avoid the disaster which threatens your world, and the beings on our worlds around you. This is in order that you may share in the great awakening, as the planet passes into the New [Age of Aquarius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Aquarius). The New Age can be a time of great peace and evolution for your race, but only if your rulers are made aware of the evil forces that can overshadow their judgments. Be still now and listen, for your chance may not come again. All your weapons of evil must be removed. The time for conflict is now past and the race of which you are a part may proceed to the higher stages of its evolution if you show yourselves worthy to do this. You have but a short time to learn to live together in peace and goodwill. Small groups all over the planet are learning this, and exist to pass on the light of the dawning New Age to you all. You are free to accept or reject their teachings, but only those who learn to live in peace will pass to the higher realms of spiritual evolution.

After that we had a call and I ranted about how there is no application of block-chain technology besides the problem it was invented for: Bitcoin. He seemed rather interested and started asking questions. Like : 

""Yeah, I heard about Bitcoin but how does it work?"" ect.

I slowly ended up lecturing him for 3 hours about bitcoin and why the  world needs hard money. Inflation, FIAT, Debt crisis, rising authoritarianism, the whole deal. I recently read the bitcoin standard so luckily I had the argumentation matters quite readily at hand. He then started to ask more specific questions like: 

&amp;#x200B;

* ""So, if a friend wanted to convert his money under the mattress into bitcoin. How would he go about that?""
* ""How does a transaction take place?"", 
* ""What do I need for this to work?""  
""If I wanted to use that Bitcoin to buy something, how would I do that?""
* ""How could I accept bitcoin as a payment method?""

2022-02-25 16:59:57,"Bitcoin multi-sig questions After tumbling down the rabbit hole of self custody and understanding Bitcoin, I want to move on to the next step: **Multi-sig**

I could use some help from the broader community on this.

1. I have 2 ledger nano x and would like to use multi sig (2 of 2). Are there any reliable wallets that support it? I tried using electrum and keep getting error to connect my ledger even though both ledger are connected at once using separate USB cables at separate USB ports.
2. Then I moved on to using [Caravan](https://unchained-capital.github.io/caravan/#/) from Unchained Capital and It worked flawlessly. However the derivation path it uses is different from the one Electrum uses. I imported the xpub keys from Caravan into my electrum wallet and used the same derivation path and voila! I see the same receive addresses and balance as the Caravan web app. However, the problem #1 still persists. So right now, Caravan is my only choice that I found works.
3. This relates to a technical implementation of how multi-sig works. Does the 2 devices generate a new private key akin to using a completely new device? So to oversimplify this, does it do something like this: sha256(sha256(account 1) + sha256(account 2)) or is it an enforcement of multi-sig on the blockchain itself? My concerns are that in case the private key for the new account is leaked, will my account be vulnerable to theft? or is the enforcement of multi-sig on the blockchain so that my account absolutely HAS to have the 2 devices to sign any transaction. How is this enforced? Does the signing of the second transaction have to be within a few blocks of the 1st transaction? 
4. Does it matter in a 2 of 2 configuration the order of keys I use? Does account 1 and account 2 give the same address as using account 2 and account 1 ?
5. I have seen some services online that allow you to have 2 of 3 multisig where you control 2 keys and they provide the 3rd key. Are there such services that are non KYC and free?

Bitcoin uses too little energy and it really needs to use a lot more. Since energy so important and very scarce right now we tend to fight over it. Imagine if humanity started capturing most of the worlds natural and energy like solar, geo-thermal, hydro-electric, etc to mine bitcoin and secure the network. The ideal goal would be to incentivize capturing nearly all of the worlds natural energy like a massive super grid . That massive power source could be used for space exploration or any other humanitarian needs. Texas is using miners to be able to provide extra power sources for power surge needs and because the miners will happily turn off their rigs to help people. Roughly 95% the worlds energy could be used to mine bitcoin and the other 5% could be used to power the rest of the world with abundant clean energy. The entire world would have access to free energy to grow food, heat their homes, cooling, enjoy life, etc. and at this point you have something truly beautiful; bitcoin would essentially be decentralization backed by physics. 

Let that sink in.

Property rights, rule of law, money all backed by physics. Trust in physics, math and code instead of governments. History could be written in blocks and the integrity of the data would be undeniable.

Does this drive countries even more to strategically target raw materials (i.e. poor countries with natural resources) to gain control of markets?

\-------

I see many people arguing over the relative merits of bitcoin versus cash in times of war/crisis/etc.

Since the very unfortunate people of Ukraine are involved in the first conflict where this has come up on any real scale though, clearly no one can speak with certainty on this issue yet. 

That said, I suspect the likely answer (at this point in time) is that it would depend on the amounts in question.

Since cash is currently more widely accepted, people are probably still wise to keep practical amounts of physical cash (1k$-$5k) for desperate times. They should expect to pay much higher prices for goods though, as cash (or any intangible asset) quickly loses value in times of scarcity and bartering quickly becomes the norm. After all, neither cash nor bitcoin (nor gold, etc) will be of much use relative to food and fuel if you're starving or freezing to death. I personally would be very hesitant to accept cash in such circumstances as it can be both quite easily counterfeited or stolen from me by others. But that's just me and fully acknowledge the fact I'm comfortable with using bitcoin already.

So what about bitcoin during these uncertain times? Yes, there have been encouraging stories about people selling cars for bitcoin and this is what I imagine the future of such conflicts will look like once it becomes as widely accepted as cash. But the true value is in *actual wealth* preservation. Think you're going to be able to carry your retirement account across the border in cash? Think you can pick up your vacation home and move it to somewhere else? Hard to carry fine art, jewelry, or gold bullion on your back when you're fleeing for your life or crossing borders riddled with guards with sticky fingers. 

This is where the real use case for bitcoin is as far as I'm concerned. Large amounts of wealth that can now easily travel with you anywhere in the world, at any time. It is truly an unbelievable invention in this regard.

Of course, it would be unreasonable to expect such a system to work if only the ""good guys"" get to use it. Indeed, bitcoin will likely be used to circumvent sanctions, buy illicit goods, etc. But so will cash. And only one system can truly claim to protect the wealth of every human on earth who cares to use it and preserve its value into the future.

2022-02-27 21:36:22,"trying to understand how a govt would ban bitcoin Obviously we all know that the government can't really seize/freeze bitcoin assets like they can in the traditional fiat sense. But I'm trying to wrap my head around how a govt would go about trying to ban bitcoin and what the implications of that would be.

Some potential avenues, but not sure how feasible/probable any of these are. Obviously my examples are all based on most coins having been KYC'd which I think is a fair assumption given most major exchanges require it. I also really have no idea the practical/legal limitations of what I came up with, I mostly just thought about worst case scenarios:

* I doubt they'd actually try to seize the bitcoin of every individual but maybe they'd go after high profile or high value wallets — shouldn't be too terribly difficult to trace from KYC exchanges.
* They could make it illegal to transact in bitcoin, so you couldn't use bitcoin to buy anything mainstream. This might force bitcoin back to being used mostly for the black market.
* They could also legislate that you wouldn't be able to use bitcoin as collateral so taking out a loan against your holdings wouldn't be possible.
* Even if they didn't care about seizing the bitcoin itself, could the govt just wait until they cashed in for a) cash or b) literally any other asset they could then seize?

An issue I have found among friends is that a lot of them use Bitcoin to buy various goods but they have no interest in Bitcoin or crypto which makes the process of using it quite daunting and costly.

They are given a price for an item in Fiat, usually dollars. They then need to find an exchange, sign up to said exchange, work out the amount of BTC they need to buy to equate to the amount of USD the seller wants to receive, then add to that amount the amount of fees required to top up and the transaction fees. The chance of getting this figure spot on is pretty minimal and usually ends up in either the buyer have an extra amount left in their account which isn’t cost effective to withdraw or it ends up with them not sending enough to the seller meaning they have to go through the whole process again to send a much smaller amount therefore having to pay fees twice and then chances are after this second time the buyer will then have the first issue of having a small amount of Bitcoin stuck in the exchange. 

My idea is to be a middle man so a buyer can message me tell me the amount of FIAT their seller wants to receive along with the recipient wallet address and I can then give them a GBP price to send me to make sure the seller receives the correct amount.
This would take the stress out of topping up wallets, signing up to exchanges, working out transaction fees, sending crypto etc for the sender whilst I would make a fee included in the GBP price I’d provide.

My experience come from trading BTC over a few years on LocalBitcoins although I’ve been out of the game for a couple of years. 
I’m aware since then the cypto space is more regulated but it’s quite confusing as to what regulations apply to who.
From my time trading on LB I would want to make sure I have a KYC system in place to prevent me being scammed but am I correct in thinking I would now need to be FCA regulated? 
I can trade on LB without being FCA regulated with the only difference being I would be sending the BTC directly to an external wallet rather than an internal wallet as on LB.

2022-02-28 03:01:27,"Orange pilled my girlfriend today: Bitcoin is Humanity’s Ultimate Property Right Discussed below logic:
- Russia sanctioned from SWIFT system
- System built by Western world
- Being ‘built’ usually means system can be controlled by the creater and moderator
- This means it’s centralised
- Therefore, Western world can moderate Russia’s access to money
- Taking a step back
- Property right is one of basic human rights, along with right to belief and freedom of thought and speech
- Such fundamental and basic human right should not be “protected” or “controlled” by the system and its moderators
- Property right, ideally, should be obtained/given to individuals without reliance on any system, similar to freedom of speech
- Today, money is the ubiquitous access to property and value
- However, today, money, US dollar, value transfer system is under a centralised system which can blocked and controlled to protect citizens and stop criminal from using money to carry on elicit activities
- Rightly or wrongly, the government have power to control the system so that they can stop criminals and elicit activities
- However, the flipside is that the government has the power to intervene and reduce one’s property rights - rightly or wrongly
- Today, Russia is criminalised and therefore their acccess to proeprty rights, along with their citizens, can be reduced
- Those living in 1st world countriers live far away from this being their reality as their currency and prorepty are rather well protected
- However, those living under a corrupt regmine (e.g. Africa, LatAM), can the citizens really believe and trust the system under which their prorperty is suposedly protected?
- All this leads to an arguemtn that, property right should be universal and as basic as freedom of speech 
- However in today’s world, money and currency is a governmen-backed right-to-prorepty and on a global scale, under the dollar hegemony (as dollar is seemingly the safest vs. let’s say the Korean currency)
- Property right should therefore be decentalised
- Bitcoin is the only property that can do this job

Gf’s response was: right so people who don’t trust the system they live under will want something that is definite value that cannot be intervened by someone else but you

I think I will give it at least 3 months to decide if it is a reasonable approach. There are some hurdles that I can think of that I will list below and my solutions (or not) to those problems. I would also like some input for any issues that I have no considered.

Any input is appreciated!

**DIRECT DEPOSIT**

The first hurdle. I want to have my W2 income converted directly to BTC. I have found OnJuno which is a digital bank account that looks like for the most part it could work for my needs. One hurdle I am seeing is that they limit the “crypto paycheck” to $10k monthly. My monthly paycheck is at least twice that. I could convert the $10k to BTC and then purchase BTC for the remainder. This could work and may be beneficial as I will undoubtedly find SOME things that require USD.

Another option is the coinbase direct deposit. I have not looked as deeply into this one but I don’t think it can be converted directly to BTC. This seems more like a convenient way to DCA. Nice. But not what I’m looking for.


**PAYING BILLS**

Again, with OnJuno I think I can get around this. I need to see if OnJuno offers checks (I don’t think they do since they have no overdraft privileges). I think I can get away with using a debit card for the vast majority of my bills. One exception may be my mortgage or other businesses that require an ACH withdrawal for payments.


**DAILY PURCHASES**

OnJuno allows you to hold USDC and spend that via your debit card. This is convenient, but still keeps me pegged to fiat. My assumption would be that I would keep most of my money in BTC and convert to USDC when I need to pay for something. It would be more ideal to just pull from BTC for purchases but not the end of the world there.

This is my thought. I’m sure there are plenty of holes here. Please Swiss cheese it up and let me know what I’m not thinking of!",-0.9805678725242615,0.20384615384615387,0.4306623931623932,0.08,0.022,0.898,0.9639

2022-02-28 14:55:48,"I don’t think Putin will ever adopt Bitcoin as a currency in Russia, here’s why My reasoning goes like this:

If you look back into history, whenever a king wanted to go to war with other countries, he either needed to save a lot of tax and donations money or rob all citizens to fund the war. The act of robbing all citizens, especially rich families in the kingdom normally resulted in high risk of coup for the king himself.

Imagine Putin having to introduce a new law in which all Russian citizens, including billionaires and soldiers, have to send the government half of all the money in their bank account to fund a war, he might lose his throne even before he gets to set foot in any country. He can’t do that.

But he can print unlimited rubles, it’s equivalent to robbing all people who are using that currency to fund war through dilution and inflation, but much fewer people will react, if they even know that they are being robbed.

I can’t imagine any sane overlord who would give up that ultimate power over others. The power to rob everyone at the same time, without notice, to do whatever the hell he wants, be it lining their own and friends pocket, or funding a war.

Yes, Putin might use the Bitcoin payment rail to dodge SWIFT sanctions, he might allow miners to continue mining Bitcoin and collect their tax into Russian reserves. I don’t think he will ever pull a “Nayib Bukele”. In fact, I don’t think any politician in the world gives up that much power willingly, they will fight for it until the bitter end. 

If you understand that, you’ll understand a whole new layer of meaning behind Hayek’s quote: “  ""I don't believe we shall ever have a good money again before we take the thing out of the hands of government, we can't take it violently out of the hands of governments, all we can do is by some sly roundabout way introduce something that they can't stop""",-0.9946179986000061,0.09504820936639122,0.4643526170798898,0.079,0.107,0.814,-0.9308

I call it 'The trifecta of incentives' Russia has been sanctioned to hell and is being cut off from the Swift network so I was wondering how this would affect Bitcoin adoption in the country and I've came up with three general ideas as to why Russia should turn to Bitcoin which I have labelled as 'The trifecta of incentives'.

\#1 - A decentralised medium of exchange to circumvent the sanctions and exclusion from swift to continue to conduct international trade with its partners (i.e. the recent gas deal with Pakistan).

\#2 - A store of value and global asset to limit exposure to the Euro and Dollar in Russia's international reserves as almost half of their total reserves are now frozen because of the sanctions.

\#3 - A chance to displace the dollar as the world reserve currency and therefore severely reduce US hegemony in the world with a mathematically sound, decentralised and non-corruptible digital asset - Bitcoin.

It seems to me that Bitcoin is absolutely perfect for Russia right now, especially as the Rouble is going to shit. What do you guys think? I seriously think it's in Russia's favour to adopt Bitcoin right now.

2022-03-01 01:32:21,"2022 has shown how valuable self-custody over your money is. After 8 years of hodling, I value my Bitcoin more than any other asset I own. Been hodling since 2014, was very interested in the technology but never really took a deep dive into the ethos and philosophy of Satoshi/Bitcoin. As someone privileged into a first world country, BTC became an investment vehicle, I never thought about the importance of self-custody and, in turn, generally trusted my bank. I always saw Bitcoin as something temporary to appreciate in value and convert back to fiat.

 

After years of hodling, seeing the tensions of the world escalate, general populaces at odd's with their governments and oligarchal/banking cronies, the importance of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency has become so much more. From sheltering your value away from oppressive/failing gov't's (Turkey's Lira), being able to take part in some form of banking system when your particular gov't freezes your fiat accounts (Canada), to being able to transact in your country when the banks run out of cash (Ukraine &amp; Russia), the importance of keeping your assets under your custody is one of the most importance aspects of what it means to be a free citizen. 

&amp;#x200B;

Bitcoin is apolitical, it is global, it is fair, it cannot be controlled by any select few, it can never exclude anyone in need. Bitcoin is there when banks/fiat fails. For all these reasons, I value my bitcoin more than any other asset in my life. It is my line in the sand that I refuse to be a part of this legacy system that perpetuates so many negative aspects in society today.

I’m 38 and the last 2 years have shell shocked me.

Last year, I was finally open to self honesty. My goal is to help others. Maybe this helps you. Here’s what I’ve learned so far:

1. Majority of people are in denial. People are unhealthy-we are addicts. Addicted to energy drinks, drugs, social media, food, toxic news, and even crypto.

2. The best thing you can do is not pester your friends about bitcoin: if your life changes in a positive way, some will naturally ask “what are you doing?”

3. Trading is a death sentence for 90% of people. Once you become a short term trader, it can monopolize your time and money.

4. If you avoid taking a big position in an asset you think outperforms long term you will become poorer. No one is wealthy by long term holding their assets in cash.

5. Bitcoin might not fix things-it might fix you-but it won’t be the great equalizer many say it will become.

6. Can you work smarter/harder and save 70% of your income?

7. We over consume, under educate, and we’re surprised by the results.

8. Fast cars are overrated and fun cars and underrated.

9. Having a written 6 month, 1 year, 2 year, 5 year, and 10 year plan will produce a lot of upfront anxiety because you will see how far behind you are. It could also save your life.

10. Don’t say it is what it is. That’s giving up. ",-0.9997602105140686,0.10730027548209367,0.5088842975206611,0.142,0.103,0.755,0.9101

2022-03-02 06:00:42,"I get hacked, 2.4 bitcoin stolen from coinomi wallet hello,

&amp;#x200B;

On 28feb2022 I get hacked, 2.4bitcoin  from u/coinomi android wallet got  stolen. 

It's an old Android 7, Samsung Galaxy s6edge (no root).

In 2017-2019 I use u/Coinomi wallet to store my bitcoin because was simple  easy to use.

In summer 2019 I decide to use that phone only like a ""cold storage"" I have u/coinomi app, windscribe vpn and google apps. I choose that because was simple , once a month I power the phone do the update on u/coinomi and the other apps  checking the wallet and shut it down.

The u/Coinomi wallet do not have the BIP39 passphrase implement ate at that time but I secure the wallet with a password , with a pin number in case somebody had the phone to be hard to unlock it.

&amp;#x200B;

At the end of February2022 I update the u/coinomi wallet to version 1.25.2 build 430 core 220 all work fine update done, I check the wallet   the bitcoin was there (I also choose the feature "" Mark do-not-spend "" in case somebody open  the wallet   no amount was display ) but today I check the address of my wallet (I have it saved in tor browser  to be simple to check the utxo ) and I see the coins  were moved \[url=https://oxt.me/transaction/812f73d94bc1eb029e72930427ea27bee4e668accaad4d3fc167a24f1de364a5\] [https://oxt.me/transaction/812f73d94bc1eb029e72930427ea27bee4e668accaad4d3fc167a24f1de364a5\[/url\]](https://oxt.me/transaction/812f73d94bc1eb029e72930427ea27bee4e668accaad4d3fc167a24f1de364a5[/url]) how can this happen ? since nobody have access to the phone.

The seed was stored on paper ,nobody  see it ,plus I wrote the words  in other order so only I  can  know the right order.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sure something was wrong with the update since is not an open source wallet  nobody knows what that wallet can  send out butt I think the wallet send the seed out to somebody because  passed 3 and half years  and  the seed was safe inside it only know happen..only after the update.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

After 5 hops I saw the bitcoin Is sent to Binance exchange address \[url=https://oxt.me/transaction/2984598d66601f7cf922f819b32da464733ec00bd5e71ce76ca6627fdc97e38f\][https://oxt.me/transaction/2984598d66601f7cf922f819b32da464733ec00bd5e71ce76ca6627fdc97e38f](https://oxt.me/transaction/2984598d66601f7cf922f819b32da464733ec00bd5e71ce76ca6627fdc97e38f) \[/url\]   I do not have a binance account but I chat with them to the live chat:

&amp;#x200B;

*Greetings from Binance security team! We are very sorry to hear about your situation. Upon checking we have found that the funds are in Fixed Float wallet.*

*The funds appear in the blockchain to have been sent to Binance because Fixed Float is a Binance Broker, this means it is another company that has a wallet with Binance for its liquidity and order book. This broker has many users, so we don't know the exact end user who received your stolen funds, we only know the funds were transfer to the Fixed Float hot wallet.*

&amp;#x200B;

I know fixedfloat is a noKYC exchange own by russians and many bitcoins come and go to  the Hydra Market.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I talk on telegram with the support guy named  Angelo and via  support ticked but they say that the wallet is working perfect and they are on the market since 2014 and  nobody have issues, some years ago I remember a guy that also lose funds from coinomi desktop wallet was a big fuss then but nobody believe it neither I  but now I think something is not ok.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is  how can somebody take  the seed from the wallet if that wallet was shut down 95%  of the time since summer 2019 ?

&amp;#x200B;

I was careful  with the coinomi app , always FORCE STOP and only open the app if  the VPN was on.

&amp;#x200B;

For me is very strange that my bitcoin was stolen after the update.

That update had something that read the seed and sent it out, I can't see other explication.

&amp;#x200B;

I just wanna share my experience , I do blame the guys that work on Coinomi , they always say \[i\]the wallet is safe nobody lose funds it's impossible to be able to see your seed \[/i\]but the app is not open source so how can this be true ?

&amp;#x200B;

Via support ticket they wrote me this:

&amp;#x200B;

*After looking through the details given we can confirm the transaction was sent from a device where Coinomi was installed. However, due to the nature of cryptocurrency transactions we cannot say 'whom' made this transaction since we are a non-custodial wallet software which means we do not track any sort of user data.* 

*Coinomi is one of the most widely known multicoin wallets and also one of the easiest to use. This means it is more likely than you think for someone to select to restore any seed into Coinomi*

*Please could you tell me, do you access the app from the same IP all the time? Do you use a VPN?* 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

FixedFloat reply via email:

&amp;#x200B;

*We're sorry that you were subjected to theft of funds.*

&amp;#x200B;

*FixedFloat is an instant non-custodial exchanger. After the receipt of funds and the receipt of the required number of confirmations, the exchange takes place immediately.*

*We do not require any personal data for the exchange. We can only request a search of the server logs (IP, user-agent, language) from our technical specialists. But we need an official request from your regional police or other representative, from their official email address in order to issue confidential information.*

*After receiving an official request from law enforcement, we will be able to send server log data and order data.*

*Unfortunately, this is the maximum we can help in this situation.*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I post this  story on reddit they close the post, If i wrote on they telegram group they tell me to stop because the wallet is good.

&amp;#x200B;

I think was an inside job.. or can somebody tell me how the hacker get the seed from a wallet that is  power off almost  all the time?

&amp;#x200B;

One of the biggest loss of my life.

&amp;#x200B;

The US would then have two main incentives:

1) Trade in a politically neutral alternative currency to the Russian Ruble.

2) Use a politically neutral uncensorable alternative to SPFS for global transactions and trade.

Bitcoin would be that answer, it is the only politically neutral solution.

If the tables were flipped and it was the US trying to get out from under Russian sanctions then the US would be quietly integrating bitcoin into their financial system behind the scenes ready for a transition to digital financial system free from politics.

The suddenness of mercenary soldiers from Chechnya, who after a big social media send-off were promptly killed only hours after violating Ukraine's border.

2022-03-02 10:50:00,"Here’s why I buy Bitcoin EVERY day. I have to admit, I’m super new to bitcoin. I had a little bit ($50 worth) a few years back but sold it for $100.

I started a recurring buy for $4/day on October 27th, basically the start of the ATH. I did this for 2 reasons.

1. I don’t have a lot of money
2. I had a feeling the market was about to correct itself and didn’t want to buy at the ATH if it was about to “crash”.

But here’s why buying every single day is great:

1. It’s $4/day. I don’t even see it, I don’t even miss it in my bank account. 
2. When bitcoin goes down, my $4 buys more bitcoin then the previous day
3. When bitcoin goes up, I’m making making money. 

That first week and a half I was buying for 60k-67k. If I threw in a one time investment that week, I’d be down 25-35% on it. But since I’m buying every single day, and bitcoin “crashed”, my average price is now ~$48k and I’m only down 7%. 

It’s a lot easier for me to get back to my cost basis than a one time investment. 

I’m at .012BTC ($600 as of this post and there was a few $10-20 purchases along the way), but that’s $600 I didn’t realize I had. 

When bitcoin gets back to its ATH, instead of breaking even, I’ll be up 20%! As bitcoin breaks it’s ATH and keeps going up, sure, my cost basis will also be going up, but so is portfolio.

Anyways, I think everyone should think about setting up a recurring buy, even it’s something as silly as $4/day like me. I know this isn’t really ground breaking information, but I’m just sharing my experience",-0.9967855215072632,0.034972492784992766,0.35404190716690714,0.091,0.006,0.903,0.9755

2022-03-02 16:50:55,"What advice can I give my mum about her awful approach to investing in Bitcoin? I’ve been slowly accumulating Bitcoin since around 2011 and told my mum about it in my excitement when it surged in December 2017. It’s painfully true when people advise to never tell people that you own Bitcoin, even if they are close family. 

In January this year, she asked me to show her how to use a Bitcoin exchange, with the intention of investing long-term with some savings she had. 

I figured it was time to give her ‘the talk’ so I told her that I never invested to make money, but to support this amazing new technology: an anonymous decentralised currency, and explained how cryptocurrencies and the blockchain work. 

I also told her the risks and warned her of the volatility of this asset, and advised that she shouldn’t invest anything she was willing to lose, and that a long-term approach is probably the most sensible. 

After ONE MONTH she impulsively sold at £28300 (barely breaking even, luckily) because of the bad press Bitcoin was getting. 

Now, with Bitcoin picking up traction again, she’s told me she wants to buy in again, at £33500. 

Despite my best efforts, she indirectly refuses to take my advice because I’m “not an expert”. And it pains me to see her risking her savings as an amateur ‘investor’ with a weak and spontaneous mentality in an extremely unpredictable market. 

So I was wondering if anyone could please recommend a reputable book/video/resource I could give to her that will change her outlook on such reckless investing?",-0.990924060344696,0.12252791068580543,0.6173444976076554,0.089,0.118,0.793,-0.8358

According to a bitcoin-focused trading app, with tens of thousands of users, women and older investors are largely staying out of the crypto craze, leaving mainly young men to be the driving force behind crypto rallies and lows.  

The overwhelming majority of people using the app to trade in bitcoin are men, making up 79% of users to just 21% women. Compared with the most recent data from the U.K.’s Office for National Statistics, or ONS, this makes the gender divide among bitcoin holders even wider than with other investments.

**So, is it overconfidence?**

Barber and Odean found that men trade stocks 45% more frequently than women, which is a symptom of overconfidence because overconfident investors trade excessively

If we see from that research study that men are, on average, more inclined to be overconfident, that overconfidence could be helping to drive the heavier representation of men in these much more speculative markets.

2022-03-02 20:21:43,"Analysis: Correlation between Bitcoin and the stock market correlation are near an all time high Recently I've noticed that BTC has been following S&amp;P 500 quite closely. Of course, there's still a lot more volatility associated with cryptocurrencies than the broader stock market, but there seems to be a general trend whereby Bitcoin and S&amp;P 500 seem to move in tandem.

When researching this, I found a lot of articles reporting different correlation coefficients between US equities and Bitcoin. Some were outdated. Some actually reporting inverse correlations. So I decided to run the calculations myself, and I found that *the correlation coefficient of the S&amp;P 500 and bitcoin, from July 2010 till today, is* ***8.7%****.* Quite interesting. However, this is far from the full picture.

Next, I decided to calculate one year rolling correlations. Here's what that looks like:

https://preview.redd.it/1r8170ofhzk81.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed71f5c801e6fee10bcf3b0cb827da1f7a62fc6b

Bitcoin just recently had it's highest ever 1 year rolling correlation with the S&amp;P 500, at a whopping **44.3% correlation.** One possible explanations is that that traditional institutions are starting to adopt bitcoin. However, we only have to go back 2 years to see the lowest (most inverse) correlation. In December of 2020, *the rolling 1-year correlation coefficient of the S&amp;P 500 and bitcoin hit* ***-29.3%****.*

In December of 2020, Bitcoin also happened to have dropped 50% from it high a few months prior. It's of course not a coincidence that bitcoin's most inverse correlation with the S&amp;P 500 was during a bitcoin crash. But let's analyze further, and map bitcoin- and S&amp;P 500 crashes/corrections:

https://preview.redd.it/i1ve9oighzk81.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d2e11cc66241635275f89bba7d55e07908921b2

This reveals a very interesting phenomenon. **When the S&amp;P 500 is dipping, it usually takes bitcoin down with it (correlation is high). But when Bitcoin crashes, it can do so completely without impacting the S&amp;P 500 (correlation is low or even inverse)**. This is precisely the common price pattern of *speculative assets*. This means that the recent all time high in one year rolling correlations may in fact be explainable by the recent S&amp;P 500 correction.

I also calculated the correlations between bitcoin and other assets:

||S&amp;P 500|Gold|MSCI|ARKK|TSLA|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Long-term correlation with bitcoin|8.71%|12.78%|7.06%|20.19%|7.22%|
|Past year correlation with bitcoin|36.10%|13.84%|7.67%|37.65%|35.96%|

In all cases, Bitcoin has been more correlated in the past year. In my opinion, this indicates that Bitcoin has been adopted as yet another possible asset to diversify your portfolio with.

**Conclusion:** Adoption of bitcoin by traditional institutions seem to be increasing, but bitcoin still shows patterns of speculative assets.

2022-03-02 21:21:08,"Bitcoin as a retirement plan and transitioning to BTC net worth I've shared my plan before, but I'm sure this will hit a lot of new viewers so I'll post it again.

I'm on this journey to transition my net worth (not much at this point) to BTC. Here are my steps.  
(1) Start by DCA some amount every paycheck, for me this is about $40 every two weeks  
(2) Get a [crypto.com](https://crypto.com) or similar account, ideally one which pays good interest on your holdings, allows ""staking"" / hodling for higher interest rates  
   (2.1) define some limit you hold here, for example, my goal is to eventually get $4k worth of USDC and $4k of BTC in this account. Any gain, any excess off that will be xferred to a hard cold wallet for long term safe keeping

(3) Use a BTC debit card / credit card / ideally rewards card for as many purchases as possible, start getting that 1% back in BTC on purchases where you have to use fiat / cc / debit card  
(4) I haven't gotten enough stacked to begin doing this yet, but the plan is to keep track of my DCA price. When I get a paycheck, DCA buy in. When it comes time to pay bills I'll look at my DCA price vs actual BTC price. If BTC is lower than DCA,, it sucks to cash out to pay bills and take what feels like a loss. So instead, I'll pay out of my USDC balance. Monitor price and when BTC comes above DCA price at that time sell enough to re-balance USDC back to where it ought to be in reserve.  


On average, as I believe BTC rises in the long term, my BTC holding DCA price will regularly (eventually always, if price gets high enough) be below the actual BTC price and at that point I'll be transitioned. 100% of paychecks go to BTC and 100% of my bills get paid by cashing out BTC.

Eventually, the goal is that I never need USDC or fiat or credit cards as an intermediary and can just trade BTC directly with goods and service providers but we're simply not there yet, so in the meantime this is the best option I've found.

Finally, the retirement portion. I'm already an old man. There will come a day when I'm not able to do my 9-5 consistently anymore and need to retire. I have some fiat plans in place, but this is the way I'm looking at it.

I am hoping to live 20 years after I retire  
20 years at roughly $2k living expenses monthly = $480k  
The best part about BTC for retirement, I believe, is that it's deflationary and that I won't actually have to have the whole $480k stacked to retire because in year 1 it might be worth $480k but if I spend half of that over the course of 10years I actually expect the price of BTC to easily go up 50% in those 10 years, so my $240k remaining would actually be at least $360k

The growth of Bitcoin and it's price are going to be impossible to predict, so I don't want to be *too* speculative and optimistic, but my goal is $200k worth of BTC saved, at that time I think I will be able to safely retire and if my BTC runs out I'll be poorer but I'll still be able to live.

$200k is a lot and I have a long way to go to save that much, but with my transition to BTC as a lifestyle and stacking in a HW wallet, I actually believe I'll make it. I 100% expect BTC to 10x within the next 5 years, meaning that $200k worth of BTC 5 years from now can be bought today for $20k.

Thinking like that makes me think it's possible. Maybe it's a pipe dream, maybe BTC won't be so successful, maybe it will be successful but it will be a lot slower. I'm still not expecting to retire for more than 5 years, so maybe it's 15 years until retirement and maybe I only get to live off BTC for 10 good years instead of 20, but this is my plan and I think it's my best shot.

# Why is it mostly men who are under 30, trading bitcoin?

📷

According to a bitcoin-focused trading app, with tens of thousands of users, women and older investors are largely staying out of the crypto craze, leaving mainly young men to be the driving force behind crypto rallies and lows.

The overwhelming majority of people using the app to trade in bitcoin are men, making up 79% of users to just 21% women. Compared with the most recent data from the U.K.’s Office for National Statistics, or ONS, this makes the gender divide among bitcoin holders even wider than with other investments.

**So, is it overconfidence?**

Barber and Odean found that men trade stocks 45% more frequently than women, which is a symptom of overconfidence because overconfident investors trade excessively

If we see from that research study that men are, on average, more inclined to be overconfident, that overconfidence could be helping to drive the heavier representation of men in these much more speculative markets. It really takes a bit of a hope and a prayer to believe that these assets are going to be long-term, reliable investment performers.”",-0.9845955967903137,0.1974089635854342,0.4933473389355742,0.044,0.016,0.94,0.6841

If the internet is split in 2, Russian and non-Russian cannot access the same blockchain anymore, does that imply Bitcoin would fork as 2 blockchains? I'm talking about an hypothetical scenario where Russia would use a Russian only internet (called Runet, the project exists). No communication would be allowed in between Runet and the rest of the world's internet. Russian using internet could only access websites and data provided from Russian providers. Non Russian could only access websites and data provided from non Russian providers. 

The split between Runet and internet would be put in place and enforced by Poutine, and anyone trying to cheat it (using foreign internet through satellites, etc.), would be immediately arrested and the connection shut down, so for the question we'll consider this option as impossible.

Miners would therefore be on one network or the other, and would not be able to access each other's blockchains.

Russia’s largest currency holding is the Euro which accounts for a third of all reserves with Gold being the second largest (US dollar 3rd).

The problem:

Right now renewable energy sources have a problem, the rate in which they produce energy is sporadic often resulting in major gluts and inconsistent demand. Since the energy cannot be reliably stored, this results in what is called cycling, a plant having to shut down and restart production to suit the surrounding areas demand. Every time a power plant is turned off and on, the boiler, steam lines, turbine, and auxiliary components go through unavoidably large thermal and pressure stresses, which cause damage. This damage is made worse for high temperature components which will eventually start to fail, resulting in shorter component life expectancies which increase costs. If we want renewable energy sources to take market share from fossil fuels we need to find a way to reduce their prices to outcompete. 

Bitcoin fixes this?

This is where Bitcoin mining comes in. Bitcoin mining gives renewable energy companies reliable sources of income because Bitcoin mines can set up shop on site and act as buyers of last resort for the excess power generated and have virtually unlimited demand for excess meaning the plant won’t have to cycle or waste which is inefficient and costly. The reliable income from Bitcoin miners and virtually unlimited demand for excess gives power companies MORE money for expansion, R&amp;D , and most importantly lowers costs to the end consumer. 

The coming boon:

We have already seen this model working to great effect in Texas. Layer1, the largest US Bitcoin mine utilizing abundant wind energy buys excess power from the local renewable energy producers and mines Bitcoin, in times of high consumer demand in the surrounding areas the Bitcoin mine shuts or slows down, selling the energy it contractually purchased back to the grid acting like an insurance underwriter for producers. A harmony where both interests are met creating a huge boon in Texas renewable producers. Bitcoin miners are flocking to Texas allowing renewable producers to expand, making green energy more abundant. If you are a enterprising individual you would do well for yourself to find a way into this fledgeling market. 

Ultimately I predict Bitcoin will have the largest positive effect on renewable energy production, R+D and adoption in the coming decades. Bitcoin will do more for green energy in all forms than any industry, climate protest or politician combined utilizing game theoretic principles to achieve its ends. There are even more unique things happening in the Bitcoin mining world to look into, some Bitcoin mining companies are trapping flare gas that would’ve been exhausted into the atmosphere and using it to mine Bitcoin, for free.

However, I've come to a certain question that I haven't really found a solid answer to in books. (Perhaps I just haven't read enough yet)

I know that the default BTC blockchain is not private and only provides pseudonymity which can be eventually traced to the exchange you bought your BTC. If the exchange has KYS then it really isn't very anonymous.

I've seen mentions of decentralized exchanges as well as CoinJoins solutions to ""anonymize"" the BTC.

My question is, what are the advantages or disadvantages of anonymous vs traceable BTC from exchanges?

Is there a preference for either? Will one or the other be more heavily regulated? For example, will exchanges stop accepting ""washed"" BTC because of association with black market activities? Is any 1 bitcoin truly as good as any other, even in practice?

2022-03-03 10:31:48,"How To Secure Your Cold Storage Bitcoin For Dummies (And Broke People Like Me) *Rant incoming*

All engraving/stamping your seed words on steel does is make these “steel wallet” companies rich. Some of these steel wallets are $30+ EACH, and that’s not including tools and shipping.

Many people say to use steel backups for fire protection, however…

If your house burns down, good luck identifying one piece of charred steel from another. Not to mention the crew of firefighters and police rummaging around the site who might find it also.

*end rant*

**Assuming you’ve generated your seed words and passphrase securely…**

What I suggest is using a 12 word seed written in ink on paper + a passphrase ***not written down***. Easy to memorize all of this too.

*Boom, security*

Laminate your 12 word paper seed or put it in a plastic bag, and put a few copies in some stainless steel capsules you can buy on Amazon for like $2/each.

*Boom, flood/insect protection*

Hide the capsules at multiple locations (family/friends house, lawyer, safety deposit box, etc).

It doesn’t matter if someone steals the seed, as your passphrase is only known to you.

A secondary benefit of “geo-diversification” is that you can *strategically let a copy be destroyed on purpose.*

No firefighter/police can stumble on your seed words if it literally burns to ash in the fire. Let them cleanup while knowing your coins are still safe.

*Boom, fire protection*

(Optional) Store your passphrase in a trusted password manager. It’ll be useless without the seed if ever hacked, which has never touched the internet.

*Boom, memory loss protection*

The 12 word seed is protected from cyber attacks, and the passphrase is protected from “five finger” attacks.

In my opinion, sat for sat this is the cheapest, simplest, and strongest way to cold store your bitcoin, short of more complex multi-sig setups that are ridiculously unnecessary for most people who aren’t Michael Saylor.

If you want to regularly *spend* from this wallet, then a hardware wallet will suffice, but that’s a whole different post.",0.9981404542922974,0.041888888888888885,0.4775213675213675,0.082,0.082,0.836,0.0379

Since then, I've been buying BTC weekly on CashApp, because I learned that CashApp is easy to buy/transfer BTC to an external wallet. I decided to hold my BTC on RH until RH allowed transfers out of the account. I've made it off of the Bitcoin wallets waitlist on Robinhood, so now what do I do? My goal is to have a secure/easy-to-use wallet to store my existing BTC and to continue buying it weekly (either with Cashapp -&gt; transfer to wallet or another account).

A LITTLE ABOUT ME:

I'm a Puerto Rican/Native male from NYC that grew up in the Harlem area. I have run the city up and down during my youth which has allowed me the gift of absorbing all that this cultural melting pot has to offer.

 As a kid, I was fascinated by streetwear and the emergence of a wave of culture blending art, skateboarding and street+hip-hop. In my time growing up, fitted or tight clothing was grounds for getting you laughed at. Tight jeans were called ""nuthuggaz"", your t-shirt had to be 3XL-5XL and your pants were practically parachutes, so when I stumbled upon these communities of people challenging the status quo to create this new aesthetic I became intrigued. I relentlessly studied this new fusion of art, hiphop, and skate culture that would later become popularized. This gave me an impeccable taste in footwear and garments over time as I would go on to practically live on popular forums such as NikeTalk, Superfuture, Hypebeast etc. during their early inception to take in as much of my newfound fascination as I could. 

I became utterly obsessed, perusing SoHo's sprouting sneaker/clothing boutiques of the early 2000's, (Clientele, Supreme, Nom de Guerre, Dave's Quality Meats, NORT/RECON, ATMOS, STUSSY, BAPE and many more around the Brooklyn+Queens area (some of which no longer exist) studying their inventories and admiring the craftsmanship coming from these high end street brands. This turned me into a bit of a guru for my ""hood"" counterparts in highscool that wanted to seperate themselves from the norm of baggy jeans, marmot biggies, night gown sized white t's and jordans. 

 People from this sprouting culture had their own style back then, nobody was in a competition to look like eachother. The goal was to find the flyest lesser known and put something together that seperated you from the pack, not induct you into it. We used to acknowledge people on their own unique individual styles and showed our admiration for that back then, now we're in a competition to look exactly like one another it seems. Stamped with the same stale designer logos, recycling fits between eachother.

In summary, this is my job. To separate you from the pack and to make you a little more unique so that you can leave an indellible mark when it comes to first impressions. 

What's the point of spending money on high fashion when everyone is trying to emulate the same style? Do you want to be a little more uncommon and stand out for your garment choices or would you rather be another designer clone? Ever notice how two people can put on the exact same style of clothing yet one will look better than the other? That's because body shape and form also play a big role on whether or not something will look good on you. So does attitude and vibe. Sometimes a $300-500 outfit can make you more intriguing than a $1000+ outfit. It all depends on who's wearing it.

This is where I come in, I will find you the right pieces that COMPLIMENT your body's form and your personal vibe. I will have people talking about you upon your introductions. You WILL be remembered.
Let me help you stand out!

Contact me if you feel my services would suit you. 

Peace+Love!

It will be just few trades a year but quite large amounts(around 1-10BTC). What always discouradged me was the tax headache which comes with trading crypto and risk of holding bitcoin on exchange. I am looking for ways how to avoid this. The best solution now seems to be using liquid network. The way it would go is peggin in and getting some L-BTC for my BTC. Then the trading would consist of swapping L-BTC to L-USDT and back. When I am done I can pegg-out to BTC. All liquid assets will be sitting on my Blockstream Jade Liquid Hardware wallet. 
This way I can avoid counterparty risk of exchanges and also dont have to worry about taxes as noone can trace this. Only downside I can see is that fees will be quite high(on AI swap exchanges) and counterparty risk of the Liquid network itself &amp; USDT(should be low).

2022-03-04 21:30:00,"U.S. sanctions against Russia will push nations to add Bitcoin to their reserves. Here's why. Vladimir Putin had prepared his plan well before invading Ukraine. He has been deleveraging Russia for years and accumulating foreign exchange reserves year after year. At the beginning of this year 2022, Russia had 640 billion in reserves.

Putin thought he was safe from American and European sanctions because this sum represents 23 months of imports for Russia. Putin would have had time to wage his war in Ukraine, to take control of it, before hoping that the international community would finally accept the situation.

The problem for Putin is that the West was united against his invasion of Ukraine and responded with nuclear economic and financial measures. Measures that undermine the economic fortress that Putin thought he had built for Russia. The problem is that 16% of Putin's reserves were in US dollars and 32% in euros. De facto, half of Russia's reserves are no longer usable after these sanctions. This figure rises to 60% as other currencies held by Russia are no longer usable. Russia also has to rely on China to support it as it holds 17% of its reserves in yuan.

Of Russia's $640 billion in reserves, $130 billion is in gold. Russia, therefore, has full control over only 20% of its reserves.

When a country faces economic and financial sanctions from America or Europe, whether justified or not, it is completely stuck. A country like Russia can probably hold out longer than a small country in the economic sense.

This is where the value of Bitcoin will become apparent to more and more nations in the future. Indeed, Bitcoin offers something unique in this respect. Bitcoin cannot be controlled and therefore gives you more freedom than those fiat currencies. Adding Bitcoin to your reserves will become a necessity in the future. More and more nations will make this choice.

So what is happening now with the financial and economic sanctions against Russia seems to me to be something extremely Bullish for Bitcoin in the medium and long term. No one can be happy about this war, but it is in these dark hours that the need for an uncensored global P2P payment system like Bitcoin becomes apparent.

And this for individuals as well as for nations.",-0.9992479681968689,0.1414414414414414,0.36936936936936937,0.076,0.041,0.884,0.9074
2022-03-04 22:42:26,"As the war in Ukraine rages on turning millions of people into refugees, Bitcoin is here to help... The Russia-Ukraine crisis has certainly alarmed the world of a potential global war. In a matter of days, millions of people have been turned into refugees.

As it happens in such situations, the fiat currency is of no help whatsoever, Ukrainian citizens don't even have a home let alone access to their finances. Similar monetary conditions are plaguing Russia, with global sanctions and widespread condemnation of the war, innocent people in Russia are suffering too.

Fiat currency as expected has failed its people in the time they need it most. And it is times like these that bitcoin can greatly help people. With no global entity controlling it, bitcoin can be accessed and used anywhere and by everyone. Even the Ukrainian government is welcoming bitcoin donations with open arms as they know it cant be controlled by the Russian military.

They have posted a bitcoin link on their official Twitter account:

[https://twitter.com/Ukraine/status/1497594592438497282](https://twitter.com/Ukraine/status/1497594592438497282)

More than $56 million in bitcoin donations \[through various charities\] have been made already to help the refugees and aid relief work. 

Here's a [list of charities](https://ukrainewar.carrd.co/) put together by Ukrainian journalists. Many of these charities accept Cryptos including Bitcoin so you can donate directly from your wallet to these charities.  

Unlike fiat, bitcoin has some major benefits it allows:

* Allows for easy trans-currency exchange if fleeing Ukraine or needing to buy supplies in other countries
* Don’t have to worry about Russians taking control of Ukrainian banks
* Privacy if you are a journalist/soldier and don’t want to allow Russia to track you

The crypto community is large. We are powerful. Use that power to spread the word and shore up [support for Ukraine](https://blog.blockonomics.co/how-can-crypto-users-support-ukraine-54d9be051290).

1. The inflationary government action argument holds , but replaces it with volatile price levels determined by natural money demand. 
2. The comparison of BTC and 'fiat' currency fundamentals argue on two different theories of money. BTC on the bartering savage and Fiat on credit theory. The former of which does not take into account the role of the state and understands society better.

2022-03-05 02:40:09,"When did people start going ""all in"" on bitcoin? I understand that there are some people in 2012 that bought ""some bitcoin"" but that's not what I'm talking about.

I want to know about when people started withdrawing their life savings and selling their stock to go all in on bitcoin.

Me personally, bitcoin is my savings account. Every george washing dollar bill gets put into BTC. I sold all my stocks. I sold my ROTH IRA and paid the penalty and short term capital gains. I sold all my possessions until all I owned was a bed, a desk, and 7 pairs of each article of clothing.

I eventually would also move into my car to avoid rent payments to put more money into BTC.

This is what I consider the ""all in"" mentality. I truly went all in. 

But I didn't just do this yesterday, this was my mentality in 2020. So I went all in before the bull market pretty much.

So I'll always be in profit.

And I've been buying the whole way up and whole way down. I don't care. My whole portfolio is bitcoin.

AND MY QUESTION IS: When did people start going all in on bitcoin? As in withdrawing their life savings, selling their roth, and moving into their car?

 Because I would imagine, if someone did this in the year of 2016-2017, they would be very very well off in 2022.

If someone did this in 2014, they would be even better off.

But were there people crazy enough to put all they own into bitcoin in 2014?

At least in 2022, bitcoin is a more ""convincing"" asset. More people in 2022 see bitcoin as an investment, whereas in 2014, more people saw it as pure gambling/scam.

So how many people were crazy enough in 2014 to go all in and sell everything they own for bitcoin?

I assume more people did this in 2016-2017 too.

And I assume even more people did this in 2020-2021 because I am one of them.",-0.9791998267173767,0.21418192918192916,0.553034188034188,0.087,0.044,0.869,0.9523

2022-03-06 19:01:33,"Understanding how a Bitcoin transaction is secure Hi,

I'm trying to wrap my head about how a transaction is secure. By secure, I mean :

* Authentication : The author of the transaction can be verified.
* Integrity : The transaction has not been modified after it has been written.

I think I understood, but I'd like some confirmation that I understood correctly.

First, our protagonist, Alice has generated a secret key *alice\_secret*, has derived a public key *alice\_pub* and a bitcoin address *alice\_ad*. The secret key is a random sequence of 256 bits (well, the maximum value it 1.158E77, so some sequences are excluded of possible results). The public key is computed using the elliptic curve multiplication on the secret key. The bitcoin address is the result of *RIPEMD160(SHA256(alice\_pub))*.

Let's admit that Alice received 1 BTC from Bob through a transaction we will call TX1. The transaction is considered secure, we'll inspect the security of the next transaction. This transaction TX1 has an output of 1BTC, and a locking script as follows : *OP\_DUP OP\_HASH160 alice\_ad OP\_EQUALVERIFY OP\_CHECKSIG*.

Now Alice wants to send this 1BTC to Morgan (minus a small fee). To do so, she creates a transaction we will call TX2. I'll try to prove this transaction TX2 is secure. This transaction will have only one input, which will use the output of TX1. We need to verify that only Alice can spend the output of TX1, and that TX2 cannot be modified after it's created by Alice.

The only input of TX2 contains a reference of TX1 (its hash), the index of the output (0) and an unlocking script : *SIG alice\_pub*. *SIG* is a signature formed from a message and *alice\_secret*. The message to consider depends on the *SIGHASH* flag mentioned in the signature. Let's assume Alice chose to use *ALL* (0x01), meaning that the message must include all inputs and all outputs of TX2. To form the message, a copy of TX2 is created, the signature *SIG* is left blank, the transaction is serialized, the *SIGHASH* flag (0x01) is appended at the end of the transaction, all that is hashed (SHA256) and the result constitutes the message *m*. The signature is computed by *ECDSA.sign(m, alice\_secret)*. The signature is included in the aforementioned unlocking script of TX2, which is now complete. The integrity of TX2 is ensured because any change would invalidate the signature.

Now, to check that Alice can indeed spend the 1 BTC from TX1, we need to check the result of the script which is a concatenation of the unlocking script and the locking script (in that order). The resulting script is : *SIG alice\_pub OP\_DUP OP\_HASH160 alice\_ad OP\_EQUALVERIFY OP\_CHECKSIG*. Any nodes receiving this transaction will verify the result of this script. The script is executed as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

|Step|Stack|Unread Script|
|:-|:-|:-|
|0||*SIG alice\_pub OP\_DUP OP\_HASH160 alice\_ad OP\_EQUALVERIFY OP\_CHECKSIG*|
|1|SIG|*alice\_pub OP\_DUP OP\_HASH160 alice\_ad OP\_EQUALVERIFY OP\_CHECKSIG*|
|2|SIG alice\_pub|*OP\_DUP OP\_HASH160 alice\_ad OP\_EQUALVERIFY OP\_CHECKSIG*|
|3|SIG alice\_pub alice\_pub|*OP\_HASH160 alice\_ad OP\_EQUALVERIFY OP\_CHECKSIG*|
|4|SIG alice\_pub alice\_ad|*alice\_ad OP\_EQUALVERIFY OP\_CHECKSIG*|
|5|SIG alice\_pub alice\_ad alice\_ad|*OP\_EQUALVERIFY OP\_CHECKSIG*|
|6|SIG alice\_pub|*OP\_CHECKSIG*|
|7|TRUE||

Between the steps 5 and 6, the operator \**OP\_EQUALVERIFY*\* is executed, it compares the bitcoin addresses of Alice, one comes from the locking script, written by Bob in TX1, and one is computed from the public key from the unlocking script, written by Alice in TX2. This ensures that Alice was indeed the recipient of TX1. I think it's weird that TX1 doesn't provide \*alice\_pub\*, it would make this step useless. Supposing Bob knows *alice\_pub* :  **Why isn't** ***alice\_pub*** **included in TX1 locking script instead of** ***alice\_ad*** **?** This would make the script shorter and simpler. Furthermore, that's not a limitation of Bitcoin, it's doable. The whole script could be : SIG + alice\_pub *OP\_CHECKSIG* (where + separates the unlocking and locking scripts).

Between the steps 6 and 7, the operator *OP\_CHECKSIG* is executed, it verifies that *UCDSA.verify(m, alice\_pub, SIG)* returns *true*. Where *m* is computed the same as before.

So, do I understand correctly ? Did I miss something ? 

Also, if TX2 isn't mined into the blockchain yet, she could very well repudiate this transaction by writing another transaction consuming the same UTXO, with a higher fee to ensure miners choose this new transaction, **right ?**",-0.9503564238548279,0.01451376004947434,0.526454596990311,0.069,0.014,0.917,0.9886

2022-03-06 20:05:37,"Safest way to secure your bitcoin I've been thinking and researching this topic for a while, as it is the single most important thing you can do, other than buying bitcoin and supporting the network.

Of course, you need to take self-custody, and that means storing your bitcoins in your own wallet. In particular, a multisig approach is recognized as the best one. Also, it's essential that you record your seed phrase in a form that's impervious to the elements, like those metal plates.

Now for most people, keeping one seed phrase with them, another with a trusted friend/family member and another at a safe deposit box is enough, as long as each of them are well secured. However, what if you are targeted specifically for your bitcoins? It would not be so so so hard for sophisticated thieves to take your seed phrases. Mind you, these guys would need to be super sophisticated, but still it's possible.

I thus propose a third layer of security, and that is encoding your seed phrases (and removing all explicit existence of the seed phrases themselves) and NOT storing these codes anywhere other than you and your trusted party's minds. This way, even if the thieves get access to your secured seed phrase encodings, they won't be able to decode them and get your seed phrases. The safe deposit box one does not need to be encoded.

For this to work, you need to:

- Choose simple personal codes, but hard enough that it'd take too long for the thieves to crack. Ideally the encodings look like a regular seed phrases.
- Memorize all the codes yourself. Only you have access to the safe deposit box.
- Make your trusted party memorize your code, but don't tell them theirs.
- In your testament, give access to the safe box to your trusted party.

Now, the only possible ways you would lose your bitcoins are the following:

- Both parties lose their memory at the same time, and thus the codes. This is obviously very unlikely. And also solved with the help of an heir (see below).
- Both parties lose their lives at the same time. Again super unlikely, and you heir/s would get them anyway.
- Two out of three encodings/seed phrase get completely lost. Completely lost would mean something like an earthquake happens or they get stolen by sophisticated thieves. But at least they won't be able to access them either, unless...
- The thieves threaten to kill you and your party. In this case you would try feigning ignorance about the codes/encodings. Specially if the encodings look like seed phrases, you can claim you recorded them wrong.

How to pass on your bitcoins after death? Tell your heirs the code to your encoding, and in your testament specify where this encoding is located, as well as an order to open the safe deposit box for your heir.

A couple of days ago I posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/t6vrpj/bitcoin_has_given_me_a_breath_of_hope/), I received a DM from someone telling me that I had captivated him and that he wanted to help me, my alerts were immediately activated, nobody gives away 0.5 btc, not even having 100, 1000, or 10000 btc, let alone someone random, these actions only occur in large social events.

To continue the game I sent him a btc address, he told me that he would do it for me later because he was not at home.

I just wanted to know what would happen next, I did not close the door on it being real because although it is unlikely, there are generous people.

we kept talking and he told me he was a software developer and sent me a link to download his software. at this time it was obvious that it sent malware.

I downloaded the software in a virtual machine with an active vpn so as not to reveal my ip, I scanned it with virustotal and there were no results, I proceeded to install it to check what it was doing and notice that it was a modified version of crypto-yank.

&amp;#x200B;

it is an old school malware that changes the addresses of btc and other cryptos and replaces them with addresses of the attacker.

&amp;#x200B;

anyway

\-Never trust the software you install on your computer.

\-You are more likely to win the lottery than to receive money from a stranger.

\-Always verify the wallets where you will send your coins.

“Anthony Pomp” is a great resource to stay on top of the news for bitcoin only. 

Don’t, listen to anyone trying to recommend an alt coin. Stick to ONLY the top 5 coins listed on Gemini or Coinbase. And don’t deviate from that. EVER! Hype coins are Sh** coins! 

Step 1: Buy a hard wallet like Nano Ledger. 

Step 2: watch videos on how to use it 

Step 3: Dont trade bitcoin - day to day. Just hold it and “dollar cost average it. “ meaning wether the market is up or down just buy because you believe in it.  

And lastly NEVER EVER- send your bitcoin to anyone, that’s promising you a return of any kind. Crypto transactions are irreversible. 

And again self educate - YouTube is the best resource. But don’t listen to anyone who is saying why you should invest in a certain type of coin. Just learn the fundamentals of crypto and bitcoin.

If anyone wants to invest their bitcoins for considerable returns, you can look into this.

President Joe Biden will sign an executive order this week to task federal agencies with assessing the risks and opportunities that Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies bring to the U.S. and outline the government’s strategy for the market’s regulation, reported [*Bloomberg*](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-07/biden-to-sign-crypto-order-as-industry-faces-sanctions-pressure?srnd=cryptocurrencies-v2).

The order will direct federal agencies to examine potential regulatory changes and the national security and economic impact of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, people familiar with the administration’s plans told *Bloomberg*.  


“The executive order, which has been in the works since last year, will require federal agencies across the government to report later this year what they’re doing regarding digital tokens,” per the report. “The plan is expected to begin carving out roles for agencies across the government, from the State Department to the Commerce Department.”

Regulatory efforts [would also involve](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/biden-administration-to-regulate-bitcoin-as-a-matter-of-national-security-report) the Treasury Department, National Economic Council, Council of Economic Advisers, and the White House National Security Council.

Bitcoin has risen to the spotlight since the U.S. and its allies began imposing restrictions on Russia in a push to isolate the country’s economy and suppress its abilities to continue marching forward in its Ukraine invasion. Despite being a [tangible alternative to Russian citizens](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/biden-imposes-sanctions-on-russia-bitcoin-jumps-to-39k) who may now find themselves unable to send and receive money freely, Bitcoin is [likely unable](https://www.btcpolicy.org/blog/no-bitcoin-wont-save-russia-from-western-sanctions) to equally help the nation bypass Western sanctions altogether.

However, U.S. lawmakers have expressed concerns regarding such a possibility, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, who [sent a letter](https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2022.03.01%20Letter%20to%20Treasury%20re%20OFAC%20crypto%20sanctions%20enforcement.pdf) to the Treasury Department inquiring about its plans to combat an eventual Russian usage of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency.",-0.949459433555603,0.04605263157894737,0.31666666666666665,0.068,0.028,0.904,0.872

Venezuela is a parallel reality, there is a huge group of people who depend on a subsidized box of food per month with poor quality products with little access to education, health and services such as electricity with constant cuts, dream internet speed is 10Mb and A breakdown can take you years to fix. 

there is another reality of another group where people are really millionaires, with mansions in exclusive places where the services are first world, first world hospitals, luxuries and fiber optic internet, for that group venezuela is a paradise with tax rates almost nil.

I am in the middle of both groups, closer to poverty, this group is the majority of Venezuelans, we live from day to day and it is really difficult to save and in most cases impossible if you do not have a means of generating money in $, I feel lucky with what I have, and my savings in bitcoin have me close to fulfilling my life goal, which is to buy a house for my wife and my son because we live in a 3x3 room in his parents' house, I calculate 1 year to meet my goal, I work repairing computers at home, I also install security systems for companies and do technical support services.

I am not telling this with the intention of being sad, I am only telling it to give context to my experience.

Venezuela general vision, when I say that Venezuela is a parallel reality, I am not lying. Venezuela is the country with the largest oil reserves in the world and rich in minerals, however there are problems with fuel, here the oil industry is bankrupt, the machinery to process crude oil is damaged or unusable, there are subsidized gas stations where They can take days to load fuel and others at international prices that not everyone can afford, so they are always available to those in ""high society"".

 the minimum salary was increased to $29 per month. 

there is a cryptocurrency called PETRO backed by the country's reserves, 1 Petro is currently equivalent to approximately $60, it is not reliable at all because the current government likes to appropriate the wealth of those who do not like them. 

Bitcoin mining farms exist on many military installations. 

Although our currency is the ""Bolivar"", everything is traded in $ and cryptos are used in many stores.  

here having 1 btc is a reason to keep it top secret, they can kidnap you, or corrupt police officers extort or incriminate you with the promise that you give them money in exchange for your freedom

2022-03-09 10:20:41,"Jupiter has Chosen Bitcoin  

Jupiter has chosen Bitcoin, and I have proof.  

First and foremost I must define time in accordance with this planet of wealth.  It takes roughly 12 years for Jupiter to orbit, however it’s found that 7 orbits of (**83 years**) produces a fairly stable cycle of Jupiter (meaning that it’s at close to the same time of year at beginning and end, and without too much shift in the geometry of the conjunctions)

Secondly, we know Bitcoin has great respect for Jupiter, as it reversed course 3 times in 2021, every time Jupiter switched Zodiacs. (Shoutout to MAREN on Twitter for teaching me this, I thought astrology was stupid before)

Let’s follow Jupiter back through time.

2022-83 = 1939  (WW2 Started)

1939-83 = 1856 (Civil War begins in Kansas)  Side note, 2022 is also the 1 Neptune year anniversary

1856-83 = 1773 (Boston Tea Party) Side Note, 2022 is also the 1 Pluto year anniversary

Now let me jump back further so we can grab Baphomet for our summoning ritual

2022-830=1192 (The third crusade ends with Muslim victory)

As you may know, the Knights Templar were both responsible for revolutionizing banking and accused of worshipping Baphomet (A corruption of the word Muhammad) Probably nothing right?

Now we must put together our spell.

In 1945 the US dropped a Nuke on Japan.  This made the dollar the global reserve currency.

1945 + 1 Jupiter orbit = 1957 (“In God We Trust” is added to the Dollar) 

1957 + 1 Jupiter orbit = 1969 (Follower of Baphomet sets down the teachings and rituals for the church of Satan)

I'm not sure if this is a divine negating power, or admission that the dollar is Satanic. I just know what must be done.

With this, we channel the power of Jupiter... from World War 2, from the Civil War, and from the Boston Tea Party.  We call on Neptune, We call on Pluto....   and we blast the NATO Dollar with the Power of Baphomet.  Let us leave the era of Crusades and banking wars in the past.  Let there be Bitcoin.",0.9804394841194153,0.05948203842940686,0.40641186299081034,0.074,0.062,0.864,0.5481

\- Joe Biden wants to develop blockchain technology, but he wants to protect consumers and businesses.

\- To do this, he will coordinate the actions of different agencies - the Treasury Department, federal agencies, and national security agencies.

\- The states have confirmed plans to issue a digital dollar.

2022-03-09 21:33:14,"Does it bother anyone else, the confiscations that are happening of Russian oligarchs' various private property??? (Of course Bitcoin provides a way out which is wonderful) So, the west doesn't like that Russia invaded Ukraine and I can fully agree with the idea of cutting Russia off from SWIFT, not buying their oil and otherwise not doing business with them going forward.  That's our right, we don't have to buy anything from anyone if we don't want to.  But I have a serious moral qualm with the seizures of the various assets of Russian oligarchs (or ordinary citizens or whatever), seizures which are done at the whim of the host governments.  I've read various articles about it, but there are assets from yachts to private jets to real estate, which are all being seized.  Now here's my point - that's not OUR assets.  Those don't BELONG to the western governments in question.  Nor do those assets belong to anyone else, other than the Russian person who owns (owned) them!!!  They just don't, man!  I mean, it's their property, not ours.  We may not like what they're doing, but it's still THEIR property. 

I'm a real stickler for property rights.  And it pains me to watch as property rights of so many people are being violated around me by my government.  Because it raises the potential question - will they on an arbitrary whim, for whatever declared reason they deem, at some point decide to confiscate MY property as well??  After observing how casually they are doing this to the Russians (Biden even BRAGGED about it during his speech when he declared no more importing Russian oil), I have to admit it's a serious concern!  

Again - I'm NOT saying we shouldn't impose sanctions.  I have no problem with not doing business with Russia.  My issue is the confiscation of private property which their people have worked to own.  It's just, not ours, it's theirs.  We should respect that.  I suppose the good news in all of this is that they will invariably look for a way to protect their assets going forward and Bitcoin is a very natural choice...but I hate that we come to it this way!  

Why can't we respect the other person's property?  Why do governments get such STICKY FINGERS whenever they believe they can politically get away with seizure of property?  I'm a small landlord and the eviction moratorium here in the USA amounted to nothing more than a seizure of my own private property rights....so in a weird way I can relate to the Russian oligarchs!  

Just wanted to see if I'm the only one who feels this way.  I love property rights.  They are F\*ing important, people.  They hold us all together in a civilized society.  There's a reason when I want to go to the store I go get into MY car, and I do NOT go get into my neighbor's car...things wouldn't go well if I didn't respect my neighbor's property rights, so I respect them...mainly because I want my neighbor to do the same for me.  

What we've done to these Russians, with the seizure of their property...I hate to say it, but this is REALLY wrong and f\*cked up...we need to give those yachts and planes back, and if we seize any real estate, the oligarch should be provided just compensation, just like an eminent domain seizure.

2022-03-09 22:07:24,"Impact of Russia ""disconnecting"" from global internet on Bitcoin - Upcoming fork? If the news reports are true, Russia will disconnect itself from the global internet March 11, and require all Russian based organizations to transfer their DNS to the ""Russia zone.""   


**This could be a problem.** 

In order for a transaction to get sent to the blockchain it must route through the internet. Bitcoin's proof of work requires consensus, and for consensus to happen--miners need a way to communicate with each other. For the internet at large this is done through Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). 

If Russia successfully disconnects itself from the internet and denies the rest of the world the ability to route blockchain transactions in or out of Russia--their miners will not be able to maintain consensus. 

**What could happen?** 

I'll say first that they're not likely to disconnect 100% and would probably maintain the ability to route crypto transactions. Even with China's ""Great Firewall"" they still allow crypto transactions to flow. 

What about if transactions ***can't*** flow in and out of Russia? Bitcoin will essentially fork. With the inability to maintain consensus with the outside world, Russian miners will be maintaining consensus amongst themselves. Meanwhile the rest of the world will be maintaining their consensus as normal, but this will mean the consensus and the Bitcoin blockchain itself would be different. 

This means that the *price of Bitcoin could be dramatically different* in Russia than it is for the rest of the world. It also means that Russian miners by themselves can reach a consensus on a Bitcoin fork without the rest of the world. Would they even want to though? 

**Impact of a Russian Fork**

Scenario 1: Russia disconnects 100% and never comes back

* BTC blockchain would be the same up until the date transactions cannot flow in or out of Russia. 
* Russia can then use Bitcoin internally to inject money back into its economy.
   * This would essentially be a vampire attack, provided there is a way for \*some\* monies to find their way out of Russia by any means. 

Scenario 2: Russia disconnects 100% and tries to come back later

* Transactions sent from Russia would by rejected by the rest of the world because consensus on their chain would not align with the the true BTC chain. 
* Russian miners could update their chains and join the rest of the world in consensus on the true BTC chain. If this were to happen, anything they do between the time they disconnected and came back would essentially have to be erased.
* If their miners choose not to join the consensus with the rest of the world, there would be 2x BTC chains with different values. rBTC/BTC could become a new tradeable pair. 

Scenario 3: Russia doesn't disconnect 100% and allows at least crypto transactions to flow

* Consensus with the blockchain at large would be maintained. 
* Russia could then begin shifting to use BTC as its reserve currency and use it to support the ruble or bypass sanctions. 

The most probable outcome is that Russia will not disconnect 100% and will still let crypto payments flow. However this should shed a new light on potential weaknesses with digital assets like BTC, in the event that governments decide to intervene with the routing of transactions.",-0.9995461106300354,0.10151901669758813,0.35623969284683576,0.063,0.034,0.903,0.9284

Sanctioning something essentially means blocking or preventing the transacting of something. The US cannot take the gold Russia owns but it can pressure centralised companies around the world to block the movement and sale of that gold whether in physical or electronic form, because moving gold physically and electronically requires centralised 3rd parties. The shipping, freight and cargo companies that move physical bullion can be pressured, the corporations that facilitate electronic gold transactions can be pressured, and the companies that manage gold backed crypto can be pressured into blacklisting addresses. Russia could issue a gold backed CBDC and use that to sell its gold holdings but a gold backed CBDC is nothing but a promise to deliver physical gold one day in the future, which makes it worthless if the movement of physical bullion is blocked.

On the other hand bitcoin is a bearer instrument of value, its value is inherent and not reliant on any underlying physical asset. Moving bitcoin from one address to another address does not rely on any centralised 3rd party. Therefore bitcoin transactions cannot be censored or interfered with in any way meaning bitcoin cannot be sanctioned.

The movement of gold in all forms requires centralised 3rd parties while the movement of bitcoin is completely decentralised. The US sanctioning the movement of Russian gold is showcasing to the world exactly why bitcoin is a far superior reserve asset for governments to hold.

Currently, when configuring the RPC connection, there is no proxy / Tor support.

This means that Umbrel users cannot use their self hosted Bitcoin nodes with Ledger Live, as Umbrel insist that all connections to the node are carried out over Tor.

I've written a simple tool that solves this problem.

It's called py-node-tunnel. 

It runs an instance of Tor on your local machine, listens for incoming connections on a local port, and routes any incoming connectivity over Tor.

Simply tell Ledger Live to connect to localhost, and the connection will be routed over Tor to your Umbrel node, in the background.

I am curious and open to feedback on my first post describing my motivations for starting a blog.

I would also like to hear suggestions on which topics and aspects I should address first. For years, I have been brainstorming how I will contribute to the Bitcoin network. Countless walking sessions where I thought about what kind of business I could set up in this industry, but eventually, I came up with nothing… Until last weekend, when I actually realized that it is our duty to spread the word and prepare our fellow man for what may be coming. 

For many people, it remains a difficult subject, and they think mainly in terms of fluctuations in value and missed investment opportunities. The importance of a decentralized money system and capital protection through stacking sats is alien to them. 

So, I am glad that I can finally take the step to listen to my intuition and attempt to contribute in my way. I would love to hear if anyone has any ideas or suggestions on topics that definitely deserve clarification that I can use to kick off my website!

With Ukraine now added to the list, Bitcoin has consistently proven itself to be a powerful force for good in the world.

I know that there are many smart people here. While El Salvador is a great start, let's discuss how/where/when we build Bitcoin City, USA.

My thoughts:

1. Create a short list of small existing towns in bitcoin friendly states with bitcoin friendly local governments
2. State must already have no or very low capital gains taxes
3. Town must have access to large amounts of undeveloped land 
4. Easy access to renewable and/or cheap energy sources (like flare gas, wind, solar, geothermal, etc)
5. State must have small population so that bitcoiners who move there have proportionally larger voice in state and local governance
6. Urban plan the crap out of it
7. Globally crowdfund the infrastructure and best human capital
8. Create the first truly circular bitcoin economy in the United States
9. Watch other states/towns/countries follow

What are your thoughts? Is this doable? What are the barriers? Serious replies only please. I have time and money and am happy to invest both to make this happen. Maybe I'm wrong, but I suspect there are many here and elsewhere who feel the same way.

I'm convinced that part of the declining interest is due to the seemingly-high price of Bitcoin. When it was pennies, dollars, tens of dollars, anyone getting into it could own a decent share for cheap, feel like they were getting in cheap, early. Even in the low thousands, people could still own a few, it was an investment, a serious one, sure, but you could own a couple without pulling from a 401k and think about probable return if it ever did hit six figures. But now most people just starting to research crypto see that there is no easy way to own a whole bitcoin and then, if they're still interested, instead look at altcoin scams, memecoins, etc., and promptly get burned and then leave the space before they even really get started.  


What I am trying to say here isn't new. The absolute best thing for Bitcoin would be to redenominate in terms of satoshis. $100 right now buys 250k satoshis. Someone just coming into the space sees that number, sees a large quantity of whole sats that they can personally own, and gets into it, gets that dopamine rush that keeps them learning, keeps them engaged, keeps them long enough to learn how not to get burned by all the scams in the space, long enough to learn that Bitcoin is still king, is the safest investment in crypto with the best longterm RoR.

My most recent video looks at money from a first-principles perspective, and I analyze the case for Bitcoin as money. This exploration into money and bitcoin has truly profound findings. Some findings include both the HORRORS of inflating money, which is highly relevant today, and that Bitcoins price ceiling is nearly limitless if adopted as the world's money.

I think this research and the video findings can genuinely provide you with a deep insight into Bitcoin and why it will win.

I would appreciate it if you could give me a like and a subscribe if you learned something!

And this might not make sense but I feel like a transition to a bitcoin world would get rid of the need for a stock market because funding wouldn't be so much of an issue if it was built on bitcoin. I know the market is used as a way to get funding but the private sector manages this without a stock market. And if companies stayed private and were built on bitcoin not only would they have control of their own  company but they would also have a asset that continues to rise and has no  inflation.

If a person does not execute crimes, does not violate the laws, and does not do anything immoral, then he has nothing to hide, right? And if you have nothing to hide, you don't need privacy.

Meanwhile, this will be logical in a perfect world but unfortunately, our world is far from perfect.

Personal data on the Internet is hunted not only by governments but also by criminals and online thefts. Data on geolocation, business action, and social circle is the most beneficial information used by cybercriminals and fraudsters, as well as by more violent criminals.

Governments, however, are also not certain. Laws are constantly changing, and their wording is deliberately vague. And who can guarantee that a law-abiding citizen will not become a person involved in another show trial over ""the enemy of the people""?

Utopia p2p's goal is to make our less-than-perfect world safer and freer. And for the sake of achieving this, privacy is absolutely necessary today.

2022-03-12 02:32:03,"A problem I see with bitcoin Ok so before anyone freaks out here let me say up front that I am a bitcoin maxi. Most of my savings is btc and I am fascinated by the technology. I also appreciate the ethos and democratization of money. 

However I am seeing a pretty glaring problem with the btc network since I started operating a node a month or two ago. The congestion on the network seems to be a significant problem to me. I have read about the block size wars, and before I monitored the network daily I liked that the “corporate interests” of increasing block size were shunned. 

Realistically tho it’s frustrating to have to wait long time periods for a transaction to be validated in a block, and as the mempool becomes larger, so do the average fees to use the network. 

Let me also preface this with the fact that yes, I do know what the lightning network is.  Yes, I do believe that LN can take pressure off of the layer 1 blockchain but I don’t think it is enough. We all believe that we are early, and even at this early stage the mempool is currently over 10,000 tx’s which is about 8 blocks if there isn’t further congestion. If the adoption of btc increases 2-3x over the next couple of months with the rampant inflation of pretty much all world currencies, there is not the scale of the layer one to handle this. The network will become swamped and unusable. 

Beyond this, it is already pretty deep of a rabbit hole to use the layer one of bitcoin. I can’t imagine trying to mansplain to my mom about the intricacies of what to use the base layer and the Ln for. On top of this, I don’t even know myself about the characteristics of the Ln. for example, I use a cold storage device for my saving currently. If network congestion continues should I expect that I will make the vast majority of my transactions on the Ln? Can I securely save large amounts of money on the LN and is there an option to have cold storage on the Ln?

This is a serious issue. It would seem to me that the consequence of increasing the size of the block mined to even 3-4 Mb could help and with the advancement and economics of solid state hard drives, this shouldn’t be a huge issue in terms of decreasing decentralization based on cost. 

Some insightful commentary, ideas or assurances would be appreciated. Thank you for reading.",-0.9999862909317017,0.04747899159663867,0.5503501400560226,0.111,0.058,0.831,0.9806

I starting using the [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) Exchange to set limit orders and buy Bitcoin that way but after looking at their withdrawal fees (0.0004BTC) I am wondering where else to buy it. I only have less than £1000 worth of it at the moment and am happy leaving it in the exchange, but as I start investing more I am worried that an exchange wouldn't be the best place to keep it. When you buy it do you immediately withdraw it to your cold / hard wallet?

2022-03-13 19:35:00,"Helping the Bitcoin network is a moral imperative On March 14. the European Parliament is about to vote on a bill that includes an outright ban on trading with all cryptocurrencies within Europe that use Proof-Of-Work mechanism for security. This would be tremendously bad for the whole industry and especially for Europe itself.  


So lets remind ourselves why Bitcoin, the most famous POW cryptocurrency, was invented. Bitcoin was invented in 2009 as a digital alternative to FIAT. FIAT can be used and manipulated by governments and poses high risks of inflation, seizure. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is a decentralized trustless monetary network where everybody is treated equal (it's just code). This means, that no single authority can ban you from the network, seize your assets, or meddle with the basic principles of supply of the currency. Instead, it is all 100% public information. The supply mechanics have been decided at the creation of Bitcoin and therefore enforce stability and predictability. The fact that connecting to the Bitcoin network only requires a computing device and access to the internet makes it the most accessible currency on the planet. The fact that it is protected by a Proof-Of-Work consensus mechanism, makes it the most secure currency on the planet.

And now let me explain why it is a moral imperative to help sustain the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin is a safe-haven asset for those who face repression by their governments or whose currencies are in a hyperinflationary spiral. Banning trading in Bitcoin would de-legitimize the network and possibly decrease its value. This would cut into the pockets of the people who are already facing difficulties. Some examples: Many African countries with poor economics and currencies are adopting Bitcoin at an accelerated pace, due to its clear superiority in relation to their current financial systems. Ukrainians are converting into Bitcoin to flee their country as fast as possible, while ATM machines are closed and their financial systems are dysfunctional. Russians are converting into Bitcoin to save their wealth from the hyperinflation of the Ruble. El Salvador, a country with 6.5M people now use Bitcoin as legal tender to escape the dollar hegemony.

Sounds like a useful invention this Bitcoin, right? But it does have its cost, which is energy. Proof-Of-Work is the mechanism by which the Bitcoin network is guaranteed security. This is done by computers validating transactions on the blockchain, which is incentivized by block-rewards (bitcoin payouts, which also cap the inflation of the network). Proof-Of-Work is the most secure way to secure the network since it cannot be manipulated and hacked due to math and physics (you cannot prove work that you have not done).

The question remains however. What is the worth of a such a global, decentralized, trustless, secure monetary network? And is it worth the energy it consumes? The clear answer by anybody who knows and understands the importance of Bitcoin is: YES. Let me remind you that the energy consumption of Bitcoin is in direct correlation with how much value it provides as a monetary network. If the network would be worthless, there would be no incentive for miners to keep mining because the rewards would not justify the cost of electricity and maintenance of the machines. Nothing is free, or without a cost. And the cost of the Bitcoin network is mathematically deductible and transparent, unlike many other industries. But unfortunately, that transparency has made it a target for politicians who like to take a quick look at things and make rash decisions based on their prior agenda without properly weighing the costs and benefits.

Bitcoin is an incentive for greener and cheaper energy. The fact that a miners profits are dependent on their cost of energy is the biggest incentive there is for miners to look for cheap energy and ultimately green energy.  Instead of banning Bitcoin, if one were to care about the environment, one would use policy to make green sources of energy cheaper and polluting sources of energy more expensive. The best way to do this would be to enact a global carbon tax. But I know politicians don't really care about the things they say they care about so I have little hope of that happening until the Antarctic is no more.",-0.990060567855835,0.09776154401154402,0.4066666666666667,0.157,0.065,0.778,0.9968

The one glaringly obvious thing is if the bureaucrats are true to their oath they MUST recognize that bitcoin WON'T have any more a environmental impact now with it's current users than if the whole world uses it. 

BECAUSE MINING IS BASED ON BLOCKS AND BLOCKS GET FILLED..THAT'S IT.

MORE TRANSACTIONS DOES NOT MEAN MORE BLOCKS AND MORE MINING.

OK THEY WOULD SAY..IF THE PRICE GOES UP MORE MINING.

BUT THE DIFFICULTY WOULD INCREASE AS MORE MINERS COME ONLINE LEADING TO MINING TO BECOME LESS ATTRACTIVE AND WITH THE DICHOTOMY BETWEEN USERS WHO WANT LOWER TRANSACTION FEES AND UNCONFIRMED TRANSACTIONS  CAUSING A INCREASE IN FEES, WILL DRIVE USERS TO USE THE EXISTING SCALING SOLUTION WHICH IS THE LIGHTING NETWORK.

MINING IS RARELY USING PUBLIC RESOURCES (""the use of real resources""). BECAUSE BY DEFINITION SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE LOST DUE TO LACK OF STORAGE AND THE LAWS OF PHYSICS SUCH AS TRANSMISSION LINE LOSES IS NOT TANGIBLE AND CANNOT BE CONSIDERED A REAL RESOURCE AS IT IS PURELY TRANSIENT.

The European parliament’s economic and monetary affairs committee will vote on the proposed Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) framework, the EU’s legislation for governing digital assets.

A last-minute addition to the bill was added over the weekend, which aims to limit the use of cryptos that are powered by the energy-intensive process called proof-of-work (PoW).

The bill was previously removed from the framework before as it faced backlash from the crypto community.

Despite the crackdown in China, which was the top destination for crypto miners, a recent study showed Bitcoin mining actually got much dirtier and emits around the same amount of CO2 annually as a country the size of Greece.

Several EU parliamentarians have been pushing to ban PoW cryptos over energy concerns. However, they have also raised concerns that switching to renewable energy would mean such energy is favoured for crypto mining rather than for public use.

After parliament votes on the draft, formal negotiations will proceed with a round of negotiations between the European commission, council and parliament.",-0.9911178946495056,0.013802083333333336,0.19973958333333336,0.07,0.03,0.9,0.6486

[Satoshi's PoW timechain is a timeless marvel](https://preview.redd.it/k68lxufsecn81.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c4367583baf3038796b776ede2228c271bc60208)

What's the fundamental problem with fiat money Satoshi, and cypherpunks at large, sought to fix? Trust. For two reasons specifically,

1- Centralized, focused issuance and control of money supply and monetary policy

2- Trivial cost of issuance

While issuance entails no cost, money remains at the mercy of the basest of human qualities, self-seeking greed. All corruptive tendencies of fiat money are a direct consequence of the trivial cost to issue infinite money.

Satoshi’s proof-of-work algorithm solved this problem by implementing an ingenious cost of issuance algorithm that keeps every actor honest and forever scales in proportion to Bitcoin’s value as a monetary network —higher Bitcoin's value, higher the cost of issuance, and vice versa.

In PoW, Wealth != Power

My node = your node = president's node = pope's node

Someone else may have more bitcoin, but it doesn't allow them any privileges or power over you.

PoS reintroduces trust, locus of power, and easy money. Preminers/large stakers become central banks.

Bitcoin will NEVER, not today, not in 100 years, use ""too much energy.""

Bitcoin is [Dymaxion money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dymaxion)—maximum gain of advantage from minimal energy input.

They keep telling you Bitcoin would be top 30-40 for energy consumption if it were a country. What they don't mention is by value of money in circulation, Bitcoin is #14.

Energy required to secure USD - 6691 TWh/yr ([military-industrial complex](https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/files/cow/imce/papers/Pentagon%20Fuel%20Use%2C%20Climate%20Change%20and%20the%20Costs%20of%20War%20Revised%20November%202019%20Crawford.pdf))

Energy required to secure BTC - 79 TWh/yr

Bitcoin secures 3.5 times as much value per TWh as USD and emits 57% less GHG per USD value secured. This figure will only improve as Bitcoin becomes more valuable.

To be clear, this is not meant to justify the comparison. You can't compare Bitcoin to anything else, not companies, not countries, not fiat currencies. There's nothing like it. It's only meant to debunk the mainstream climate sophistry.

In case this wasn't obvious, we progress as a civilization using more energy, not less.

We're still a Type 0 civilization. How do we get to Type 1?

By overcoming central powers ([Klaus Schwab](https://youtu.be/tItp_2lGKqU)) preoccupied with selectively stifling innovation to arrogate more power unto themselves &amp; figuring out how to harness all energy resources available to us on Earth. 

Bitcoin is the key to unlocking that energy potential—by subsidizing the transition to renewables, tapping remote/stranded resources, mitigating CH4 emissions from O&amp;G, stabilizing grids and accelerating humanity towards securing a clean, energy abundant future.

A higher intelligence would laugh at us should we squander the opportunity.

The tool can be found here: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SxxfBAjOq6XTJ\_Yr7S7b0GQwxyK7dn64qbcWpSUU298/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SxxfBAjOq6XTJ_Yr7S7b0GQwxyK7dn64qbcWpSUU298/edit?usp=sharing)

This is based on my old calculation of the amount of energy used to generate the coins. At the current rate of \~91 terawatt hours per year, that is $9.1 billion at 0.10cents/kWh. So let us say 10 years at the peak rate mining, that is $91billion inherent worth in energy used in creation so far on the generous side. $91 billion market cap is $4333 BTC/USD.

Now, if we consider that the energy used to generate these coins is a complete waste due to the no-use case, the coin is near worthless. If we further consider Tether is seemingly printing Tether on risky debt, and Tether is the liquidity pool of the entire crypto market, the coin is completely worthless. As there is a chance of liquidity drying up in the exchanges, and you couldn't sell your coin for more than the transaction fee.

Indeed, the answer was clear: they voted against that vote. The final vote has culminated ""against"" with a wide victory: 32 against against 24 in favor.

The proof-of-work that was intended to be banned offers a strong security guarantee to cryptocurrencies. However, according to external information ""they have a high environmental cost due to the fact that it is necessary to consume a lot of electricity to power the ASICs (miners)"".

Source: Riot Blockchain What kind of phenomena are necessary to achieve a business that produces the value equivalent to 5 Lamborghini a day? 

 Or the question that I prefer: 

 What kind of strategy did they use to build something so monstrous?  The energy strategy The first important aspect is that the team in charge of development does not accept NO for an answer. The first proposal that the electricity company gave them was to lay out the supply line in about 36 months, which they were later able to reduce to 30, then 24, and so on. But they had enough character to get the power company to extend a connection of 800 MW and 138,000 Volts in less than 6 months.  Source: Chad Everett Harris Twitter And it is that those 800 MW is one of the most important parts of its strategy. This allows them to have a hosting of 200 MW today, and self-mining with another 150 MW while they finish the construction of another 350 MW. Once again, the peculiarities of the mining business model allow them to mine with their own machines, but also have income through hosting. 

Something interesting to note is that as a module is finished, it is put into operation immediately, while the next one is finished, and so on. This is a huge advantage over many other large projects: Being able to monetize even when execution is not complete. This point may go unnoticed by some, but not by developers of energy-related projects.

But having energy is not enough. If a farm wants to break the hashrate records of a continent, it has to speed up the construction of infrastructure as much as possible, and at a very low cost.

2022-03-15 21:15:45,"How to update Bitcoin Core in Linux Okay so I looked everywhere and was not easy to find a guide on how to actually update the version for Bitcoin Core installed in Debian. In the end it was really easy so here you go:

*For commands use the Terminal.*

1- `$ bitcoin-cli stop` first stop the node. 

2- Go to [bitcoincore.org](https://bitcoincore.org) and download the latest version for Linux.

3- (Optional but highly encouraged) Verify the file you just downloaded using the guide in [bitcoincore.org](https://bitcoincore.org).

4- Unzip the verified file, you'll end up with a folder (called for example **bitcoin-22.0**).

5- `$ cd Downloads` (go into Downloads directory where the file you just downloaded is located). 

6- `$ sudo install -m 0755 -o root -g root -t /usr/local/bin bitcoin-22.0/bin/*` (this will copy all files to the correct location and overwrite the old version files, note i entered **bitcoin-22.0** as the example folder but this may change in future versions.).

7- `$ bitcoin-cli` to run the new installed version!

Hope this will be useful to someone.",-0.9952877759933472,0.20392676767676768,0.4849621212121212,0.082,0.026,0.892,0.9067

If my only two options were 401k/Roth 401k or bitcoin, if bitcoin has only modest price growth against USD over time, is there any world where you come out on top investing in bitcoin over tax advantaged 401ks?

It seems like beginning to invest in a 401k with record inflation is lighting money on fire if I'm bullish on bitcoin. And being able to take money out on my timeline instead of dealing with 401k regs is super appealing.

2022-03-18 02:51:04,"Is the bitcoin mining business flawed?  I will preface this question with the fact that my background stems from traditional finance - i.e. pro forma cash flow statements, DCFs, return functions such as IRR / MOIC / profit, risk adjusted returns, etc. Thought his light, I am trying to better understand the rationale of a player in the industrial Bitcoin mining business. Before this gets downvoted, this question is independent of my general thoughts on the Bitcoin network itself. I am an avid BTC supporter / holder but want to separate the security and infallibility of the network from the business model of mining its tokens. 

&amp;#x200B;

In my opinion, there are three major flaws with the business model of Bitcoin mining:

&amp;#x200B;

1. In the first place, why would a new entrant participate in this marketplace if it is certain that every 4 years the potential earnings per block found is reduced by 50%. This, coupled with less appreciation of the underlying token as the price of bitcoin stabilizes while it enters it’s “means of exchange” phase as a currency ([https://vijayboyapati.medium.com/the-bullish-case-for-bitcoin-6ecc8bdecc1](https://vijayboyapati.medium.com/the-bullish-case-for-bitcoin-6ecc8bdecc1)), means your earnings will increase at a decreasing rate.
2. Bitcoin mining, imo, is one of the best IRL examples of a market with perfect competition. There are active agents mining 24/7 across the globe, low barriers to entry, and historically exceptional profit for the right operations. As a foundation of economics, perfect competition drives out profits in the long term. Looking at this through the lens of Peter Thiel, the best business venture to pursue is one of potential monopoly / oligopoly where you can provably perform 10x better than the next best competition. In Bitcoin mining, no single operation holds machinery that can mine materially faster, or use energy materially cheaper, than the next best operation.
   1. Even as one of the largest bitcoin mining operators, you are still in competition with individuals in mining pools. This is a seminal feature in an industry. In the past, it has been near impossible for any individual / remote group of individuals to compete with a major player (i.e. competition on an unprecedented scale).
3. In addition to the above, there is the concern of depreciation of the underlying hardware. Obviously, the general wear and tear / depreciation of equipment is prolific throughout business industries. However, it seems especially rampant here where operators looking to dispose of old ASIC miners, which would already hit the market with an extreme discount from heavy use, are met with a plethora of newer technology. The newer technology will not only perform more efficiently for the user, but directly translate to higher profits for them (this is different from, for example, a financial consulting company using older computer equipment to lower their technology expenses. This will lead to more inconveniences for its employees with slower systems to work on, but not necessarily impact it’s bottom line as the company can still turn deliverables at its required speed).
   1. While not a major piece of the business model, I am just trying to emphasize that one could not rely on the sale of their equipment as a significant portion of break-even cost / profit.

&amp;#x200B;

While miners secure the network, effectively enforcing its safety and validating the consistent flow of transactions, the opportunity cost of “being a Bitcoin miner” seems too large to lock capital into an operation / equipment in its current state. Why would one presently purchase a miner, or participate in a mining pool, when the business itself will 1. generate cash slower in the future than it is now 2. certainly face higher competition, and 3. see a decrease in the equity value of the underlying technology you have purchased.",-0.9841787219047546,0.18532915652056275,0.5091298024891775,0.155,0.022,0.823,0.9985

The US dollar's role as world reserve currency is now being challenged by the sanction-fueled economic agreements developing between China, Russia, India,Turkey, Lebanon and others...to the exclusion of the West.

IMO, the sanctions on Russia are backfiring and are mainly, and intentionally, set to hurt the West the most. The rising multi-polar economic world order, will, I fear only hasten the downfall of the Dollar, with hyperinflation ultimately ending it. 

How does America, and all the countries that depend on the Dollar intend to survive after that? CBDCs seem too far off to have a hope of mitigating the current fall in living standards... and there is doubt they will work as intended, or even be accepted, since it would mean the elimination of cash.

I'm expecting another country to announce they're adopting Bitcoin as a currency at this April's Bitcoin event. I think it will be a trigger for other countries to see the benefits, particularly now that they can no longer trust the US with not freezing their treasuries, much less their gold. We're in Bretton Woods 3 as a result of that.

If the West has a chance at all of economically competing with the Eastern bloc of countries with their large gold reserves, long term, Bitcoin has to become a strategic option for bottom-line sovereign survival, if not being the only option at that apocalyptic time.

I think that ultimately countries will be belatedly encouraging their citizens using patriotism to buy and hold Bitcoin, as much as they can, because collectively that will form the countries BTC currency liquidity and form a big part of national store of wealth... and the sooner that happens for each country, the higher the countries will be ultimately placed on the list, in terms of total wealth.

Since 2016, I'm already locked in 100% as a foot soldier to help the effort. I salute Satoshi Nakamoto.

I think it's time to start promoting Bitcoin ownership as a citizen's patriotic duty to save their country, in saving themselves. I intend to, and expect the MSM media to take it up, so it becomes a 'thing'...

2022-03-18 23:33:25,"Major security concern from bitcoin lover Hey guys I have recently started thinking about the bitcoin chains security long term and had some thoughts that are rather scary to think about. Currently each block gives a reward of around 6 bitcoins and in between each 4 years of the halving there is 210,000 blocks mined. So this is a total of around 1.2 million bitcoins givin out within this most recent halving cycle once the cycle is fully complete. After this cycle we will reward somewhere around 3 bitcoins per block for the next 210,000 blocks which will take us to 2028. My concern comes in with once bitcoin reaches a rather stable price assuming the world adopts a bitcoin standard, how will we keep the security for the network up? If the price of bitcoin can't double every 4 years at any given point in the future say around year 2040, then every halving from then on out will have less incentives for miners than previously. Due to this problem with the incentives miner now get the security of the overall network will start to decrease as all the miners begin to jump ship.  


Is there a way to prevent this or anything that can be done besides saying the price will literally double every 4 years forever?  


Just to be clear, I am not trying to spread FUD here, I am a long time bitcoin enthusiast and have been in the crypto space for around 5-6 years at this point. I am looking for an intelligent discussion here on some practical concerns I have. Also I hold a significant amount of BTC as well so this is not a technology I have been scared of previously.",0.9465920925140381,0.03996212121212122,0.3518939393939395,0.134,0.066,0.8,0.9538

1) My 86 year old Dad would perhaps listen to his 56 year old son or 34 year old Grandson speak on Bitcoin. Now that Zelensky is on board? Does Zelensky have to do it all?

2) Like it or not, there is 'Crypto Propaganda' in the USA that is really unfavorable, you have all heard it (gangster's like it, bad for the environment etc.) We know gangsters are stupid to use  Bitcoin because it is traceable and we know most of the power needed to do 'miracle math on digital gold' is for the Air Conditioning.

1) Brian Brooks - ""A mistake was made with the name 'cryptocurrency' it is a lot more than currency.""

2) Michael Saylor - ""It should be called Crypto Property.""

Me: I have no interest in paying for things with Bitcoin, I HODL it as I am my own bank and my own banker. My digital Gold, my crypto property.  No property taxes or capital gains if I hold and TIME is what is going to make Bitcoin great, like a fine wine, aged.

The absence of usury in bitcoins will motivate holders to participate positively in society by investing their bitcoins in business.  

&amp;#x200B;

One of the advantages of Bitcoin is that it is mined with “proof of work”. This means that in order to earn funds, bitcoin holders must invest in a business. This is different from how loan sharks make money by not being involved in the business, but only by earning interest on a loan for lending money. The concept of earning by not participating is in itself unfair and leads to problems in society and the economy. 

&amp;#x200B;

We never tire of repeating that the business of the future is a socially responsible business.  The process of creating bitcoins (mining) is open and understandable, the total number of coins is limited— BTC21M (21 million) without the ability to create new coins out of thin air, which eliminates many of the negative consequences of this.

I am an intermediate when it comes to a server setup, but I would rather prevent hassles of building code myself, so I mostly depend on binaries, which aren't directly available for ElectrumX or Electrs (also to mention that Electrs is not fit for production use). I wanted to make use of my windows machine to run an electrum server, as it already ran Bitcoin core, but the only suggestions I got here was ElectrumX and Electrs (sometimes Electrum Personal Server too), but I wanted it to be a public-grade service. When I went to r/BTC, someone there suggested me for trying out Fulcrum, which I found was much more beginner-friendly, much faster and more robust than any other implementation. (source: [https://sparrowwallet.com/docs/server-performance.html](https://sparrowwallet.com/docs/server-performance.html)) It was quite straightforward for a setup, but sadly, no one talked about it. People also said that it's not worth running electrum server on a windows machine, to which I would now say: It is! It's literally worth ruuning electrum straight on machine rather than stumbling upon dependencies during building from source, or running it on a VM or raspberry pi. You all are welcome to connect to my server: fulcrumx.technovanti.com:50025 (SSL).

I am not experienced in the field of Bitcoin mining however I know that its a really computationally expensive task. Essentially thousands of miners are searching for the ""target hash"" to the next reward block. 

I am curious if we can use prior data to our favor and try to obtain some pattern among past trials instead of bruteforce trial methods.

This question might sound dumb however, I am asking this because I cannot comprehend the randomness of each unique ""target hash"" that unlocks the block reward.

A question a lot of people have been asking me lately is how they can convert stablecoins or other cryptos to bitcoin but without using centralized KYC exchanges. 

Despite crypto being anonymous and private, the exchanges that deal with them are not. Most exchanges initially started with the same model but with time became more strict with their KYC rules. 

Thankfully these KYC rules are heavily enforced when fiat is involved but not so much when trading crypto-to-crypto. There are a few exchanges that allow users to trade crypto for bitcoin without undergoing KYC, but the catch is that there is a *limit*. 

Here is a list of exchanges where you can trade crypto for bitcoin without undergoing KYC:

**HitBTC:**

Founded in 2013, HitBTC is a leading European exchange offering a dynamic range of crypto coins, a state-of-the-art terminal, and high liquidity.

*Fee:* 0.2 — 0.08% fee based on various levels and tiers

*Withdrawal limit:* 1 BTC/24 hr or 5 BTC monthly for unverified/no KYC users

**KuCoin:**

Often called ‘People’s Exchange’, KuCoin is yet another leading cryptocurrency exchange that offers hundreds of trading pairs and high liquidity for users. 

*Fee:* 0.1% based on various levels and tiers

*Withdrawal limit:* 1 BTC/24 hr for unverified/no KYC users

**CoinEx:**

A relatively new crypto exchange, CoinEx was launched in 2017 with its headquarters in Hong Kong. It offers a user-friendly, high-speed crypto trading platform that is secure and accepts users from all over the globe. 

*Fee:* 0.3% — 0.05% based on user type and coin

*Withdrawal limit:* $10,000/24 hr for unverified/no KYC users

**Poloniex:**

A long-standing crypto exchange, Poloniex, was founded in 2014 in the USA offering a wide selection of crypto coins and competitive fees to its users. 

*Fee:* 0% — 0.1550% based on the variuos tiers

*Withdrawal limit:* $10,000/24hr or $50,000/24hr *\[if 2FA enabled\]* for unverified/no KYC users

**Bisq:**

One of the popular decentralized P2P trading platforms, Bisq offers users the ability to trade cryptocurrency without the need to go through verification. 

*Fee:* 0.1% maker and 0.7% taker

*Withdrawal limit:* No limit

**Huobi:**

Founded in 2013 in China, Houbi is a global cryptocurrency exchange providing deep liquidity and a vast selection of coins. 

*Fee:* 0.2% base fee and additional fee based on various trading tiers

*Withdrawal limit:* 0.06 BTC /24 hr for unverified/no KYC users

On 4chan I hear leaks of regulating Bitcoin by Governments who will try to change Btc into PoS from PoW after Ethereum has fully finish its move to PoS.

After Ethereum fully moved to PoS the governments agenda will instruct media to brainwash the people saying stuff like if Ethereum can do it then why not Bitcoin to save the planet from global warming and all that rubbish.

Governments will say worldwide and say they will use btc as a world reserve currency unless its changed to PoS. This will trick most on the Btc network thinking if they listen to the govt btc will go up to $100k and beyond so miners and most on the btc network will vote for a Soft Fork of the new Bitcoin PoS because everybody cares about making money not the fundamentals of true decentralization.

The SEC wont approve a bitcoin spot etf unless Btc is changed to PoS.

Once Bitcoin changes to Proof of Stake its game over for its true decentralization status and only the btc whales and governments will take over and control bitcoin.

Once Bitcoin changes to PoS can governments print more bitcoin than 21 million by changing the code after a stakeholders vote or something?

Can bitcoin value still remain high when transitioned to PoS with capped 21 million or its game over for btc because of lost true decentralization fundamental ?

To become a stakeholder or Validator for Bitcoin how many bitcoins you need?

I think this will be the biggest FUD to Bitcoin in the upcoming years as governments will try to hold btc as hostage to change it into PoS otherwise face complete bitcoin bans by governments so this will pressure the voters signallers on the btc network to PoS.

We must be prepared for this and warn everyone on the Btc network not to fall for this Bitcoin upcoming takeover by governments!",-0.9999749660491943,0.13949197860962564,0.4879144385026738,0.059,0.051,0.89,0.6003

2022-03-22 22:54:35,"With the difficulty setting a new all-time high, Bitcoin hash rate could experience a small capitulation According to calculations from MiningPoolStats, Bitcoin has overcame significant odds in the last year to see computing power devoted to mining — hash rate — reach a massive 222 exahashes / second (EH/s) this month.However, on both instances, a full recovery occurred, validating the assumption that mining will bounce back stronger than before as much as there is at least one ""friendly"" jurisdiction for crypto miners. Hash ribbons apply two simple moving averages (SMAs) of hash rate to indicate miner health, it has been used to predict when potential price bottoms are approaching.

Miners get a breakeven cost for mining each Bitcoin, and if the spot price falls below that, the risk of their ""capitulating,"" or ceasing operations owing to a lack of profitability increases. This has the unintended consequence of lowering market prices, necessitating a change in Bitcoin network difficulty to reduce miners' production costs.When the 30-day SMA crosses below the 60-day SMA on hash ribbons, it indicates that a capitulation event  has happened.

Bitcoin mining is not for me, due to the high barrier of entry. However, I just love to profit out of the news.",-0.9993077516555786,0.08785353535353535,0.4365752765752766,0.102,0.057,0.841,0.8834

Because of its decentralized nature, Bitcoin cannot be totally banned and destroyed. This is the incredible strength of the P2P payment system invented by Satoshi Nakamoto.

Even if Bitcoin cannot be destroyed, a government might be tempted one day to destroy it. I don't think it would be in the interest of any government to do this personally, because it would only reinforce the absolute necessity of having a system like Bitcoin available.

Nevertheless, one is always entitled to ask questions and discuss.

How do you think a government of a large country like America would proceed if it wanted to interfere with the use of Bitcoin as much as possible, with the ultimate goal of trying to destroy it?

I have completed the modeling runs and documented the results in a white paper, which you can access with the following link:

But lets compare sats to gold. According to [https://sdbullion.com/blog/how-much-silver-gold-is-there#mcetoc\_1flmnupju1](https://sdbullion.com/blog/how-much-silver-gold-is-there#mcetoc_1flmnupju1) there are 6 billion ounces of gold in circulation. So we could take 6 billion divided by 21 Million and find that there are **285 ounces of gold per 1 bitcoin** that will ever exist. 

If Gold is roughly $2,000 an ounce, this means that a bitcoin (based on scarcity - the number 1 goldbug argument) **should be worth $570,000 right now**. Divided by the current USD Price of $44,000ish, that means **Bitcoin is 13 times UNDERVALUED Compared to Gold.**

This of course doesn't factor: (1) Lost bitcoin; (2) Gold in the Ground to dilute the supply; (3) gold in space; (4) All bitcoin aren't even available yet.

Anyways, I actually like Gold right now. But *Bitcoin is still* at a **bargain price.**

2 years ago i decided to stop creating nfts on the ethereum blockchain since my work is only focused on Bitcoin, at that time i was not feeling good using the eth bc, or using the platforms. Since then i was looking a way to keep sharing my work, keep creating, and trying to contribute in some way to spread the bitcoin word, but i couldn't find any platform related to bitcoin, of course, many new projects showed up, new blockchains even i was contacted by one of the founders of a new nft platform built on the binance bc, but i didn't want my work to be related with that.

I was so excited when Raretoshi came out, for the first time a NFT platform on a sidechain of Bitcoin. it was what i was waiting for, what i was looking for, i was imagining being able to be part of that, be part of the Bitcoin NFT, since all the hype and noise happening on the Eth NFT space. I submitted my work immediately, but i never got any response. During that time i stop creating because my motivation disappeared. Thanks to scarcecity a platform where you can buy physical bitcoin-related artworks, i discovered the rarepepes movement, i started looking for information about these tokens, what Counterparty was, and finally i was able to mint my first counterparty NFT, this really gave me the motivation to keep creating more and looking for a way to get some support, i hope i can contribute to the Bitcoin NFT space. If you want to support my work, here is the link of my first dispenser, thanks.

The conflict has become a catalyst prompting governments around the world to re-evaluate their currency dependencies in view of the crippling sanctions imposed by western allies on Russia, sanctions that only have teeth due to linkages in the global financial system.

By comparison, crypto—and decentralized finance more broadly—are designed with the purpose of circumventing traditional gatekeepers like governments and centrall banks that impinge on financial freedom.

Florida governor, Ron DeSantis explained at a press conference on Tuesday that he’s spoken with state agencies and told them to figure out ways for businesses to pay tax with cryptocurrencies. During the signing ceremony for a bill focused on financial literacy, DeSantis said that the government is working on accepting bitcoin “for payments in the state of Florida.”

On Tuesday, Ron DeSantis, the 46th governor of Florida appeared at a press conference with fellow colleagues in order to sign a bill that mandates financial literacy in schools throughout the state. 

DeSantis touched on many subjects as Florida’s governor noted that he is concerned about U.S. president Joe Biden’s recent digital currency-focused executive order. 

According to DeSantis, there’s a lack of understanding when it comes to decentralized crypto assets and centralized digital bank currencies (CBDCs).

This will improve the usage of crypto trading platforms and copy trading Ecosystems like Coinbase, Binance, Tycoon and KuCoin. 

It’s not the first time Florida governor Ron DeSantis mentioned accepting bitcoin for the state’s taxes. Last year in December, DeSantis spoke in great detail about pushing Florida toward being “crypto-friendly.”

“There’s a difference between a decentralized digital cryptocurrency like bitcoin and what some are talking about doing at the federal level to convert U.S. dollars into basically a digital currency,” DeSantis said. “I think there’s a lot of hazards with that, when that’s centrally controlled. 

I worry about the amount of power that [it] would give someone in a central authority to basically be able to shut off access to purchasing certain goods. We’d be in uncharted territory,” the governor added.",0.6969743967056274,0.15095238095238095,0.23976190476190476,0.085,0.027,0.888,0.9423

And no, you’re average person is not going to boot up a virtual operating system to trade on some sketchy unregulated exchange or meet up with a random on Craigslist to buy/sell bitcoin. Also if businesses don’t accept it, what’s the point?

The government banned gold in the 1930’s and it wouldn’t be too hard to ban bitcoin even though it’s “decentralized”.

2022-03-26 09:43:46,"I Took 1 Whole Coin off the Market: My One Week Journey Dealing w/ the Bank Just to Buy a Bitcoin. Hey guys. Ive been into BTC for nearly 2 years now. The longer time carries on, the farther down the rabbit hole I go. 

Typically, I have been DCA'ing every pay day up until a week ago. I have always thrown whatever extra change and money I have laying around into it. I no longer buy stocks as it always feels too much like a gamble. I can never just be happy holding stocks. It was like chasing a high finding the next ""money maker."" The banks must have loved me and all the stupid fee's Id pay buying and selling as I carry on the chase. 

But then Bitcoin entered my life. And life became easier. Stocks became meaningless. A Maxi I became. No more stocks, and savings being placed entirely into the soundest money of all time: Bitcoin. 

Fast forward to January. My father has a fatal, and extremely rare stroke; a Cerebellar Stroke. You would never have seen it coming. Not your typical stroke symptoms. 2 weeks later after a battle in ICU he passed. He didn't leave much. He was a free spirit. Retired early, and lived and travelled in a van. My step-mom, who he divorced a decade ago, kept paying his life insurance that he neglected to pay. 

So with many thanks to my step-mother, I received inheritance. 

First thing I did, I paid off debts. Helped the wife pay down a lot of debt. Upgraded the house.... slightly. Nothing too major. 

Im keeping a bit of fiat in savings. Sadly, letting it get eaten away from inflation. 

The rest, I dedicated to buying up the remainder of what I need of a whole BTC. Total cost roughly, $35,000 USD.

Enter: The Royal Bank of Canada. Canada's biggest bank. A bank of which I have been with for many a year. I have savings accounts with them. I have a larger LOC with them. I used to use their investment services. 

Banks are not your friends. I am aware of this.

But, honestly, its 2022. The banking system is stuck in the 1980's.

This past Monday, March 21st, I went to the bank to wire the $35K to NDAX, a leading Canadian Crypto Exchange (0.2% buy fee, $15 transfer out fee). Did the paperwork, confirmed the info, and boom, done. Later, the advisor from the bank called to ask me some questions from the Anti-Money Laundering department. Cool, a couple verification questions. I answered honestly. Advisor said ""great, expect to receive the wire tomorrow.""

Tuesday, nothing received. This is a domestic wire transfer. Should take a day, tops.

Wednesday, March 23rd, Im in the bank again. Branch manager tells me the wire was flagged as ""too risky."" You cannot imagine the disbelief in me. The bank was deeming what I was doing with my money as ""too risky."" As if they had some control over what I choose to do with my money. Its sad enough its 2022, and there isn't an easier way to send $35K, which honestly is even that much damn money in todays age. 

After raising a stink, and showing the branch manager my Bitcoin tattoo, I informed him I was ""WELL AWARE OF THE RISKS."" I also had to mention that its risky leaving my savings in a bank that has a less than 1% interest rate in their savings accounts. I was asked to show proof that I have dealt with NDAX before. I was asked if anyone told me Id make a fortune buying BTC? Standard money-laundering questions. Check-Check-Check. Passed the test, AGAIN.

Manager put a word in with Wire Transfer department, and the money was finally taken from my account. 

Thursday rolls around now. Still, nothing. Nothing at all. Money, stuck in limbo somewhere. In some sort of electronic bank cloud. 

Today. Friday. Guess where I am again for a 3rd time? The fucking bank. More times in 1 week than in 2 years. Remember everyone... its 2022. Nope, sorry, I cannot call them because when it comes to wires I have to physically enter the branch I sent the wire from. 

This time I get branch manager involved, a co-manager involved, and of course an advisor. All looking into this shit for me. Im livid. Its Friday. The original wire was supposed to be sent Monday. Tomorrow is a weekend. WTF?!?

Turns out, under money-laundering investigation, AGAIN. More questions asked. Anyone put you up to this? Have you used NDAX before? How did you hear about them? Are you going to do business with them again? Blah blah blah. I passed again. I was told then to await an email or a phone call when this has all been settled. 2 hours pass. I email the branch manager, livid. Nothing still. 

Then, around 3PM, I was told the money was released. 

Guess I have to wait the weekend to receive it on Monday. Those fuckers at the bank!

But no! As soon as NDAX received it into their processing, I received the wire transfer! 530PM Pacific time! Last minute. 

Of course everyone will say 'HEY! DCA that shit!"" I get it. I DCA'd for so long that it was just nice to cop what I needed and throw it into Cold Storage. The few dollars Id save DCA'ing mean nothing to me in 10 years. Its nice to just have a solid 1/21,000,000, and to take it off the market. 

But that's not the total point of this at all. We need to all be happy for each other for any amount of BTC we have at any cost we got it. This is the future. This is the sound choice. 

The point is this tho:

Banks are not your friends. Banks consider you GUILTY UNTIL PROVEN INNOCENT when wiring any sort of money.

And this my friends.... is why we Bitcoin.

So on the day I dmed ‘m’, she guided me through the whole process, adding $200 on cash app and then buying it for bitcoin. Then I send the link to ‘m’ to help me out. I went to this website called forex legal trade, where I could see my cash back. It was $4700 and I was like “wow”. I tried to withdraw the money to my cash app account but the site said that I have to upgrade my account. If I wanted to upgrade my account, I would have to pay $1200 more to get the $4700. I didn’t have that money and I told ‘m’ about it. M said to invest $500 more and I was feeling overwhelmed. M said to trust her and in the end, I gave in and invested $500 more. I thought I would get the $4700 but it didn’t work and I still need to pay $700 more. I thought m would help me out with the remaining but it was like betrayed. I told m that I don’t have the $700 and she told me to find a way to get $700 because it was the only day I could get the $4700. I tried to get a loan from my bank but I was not qualified for it and all of the other options are gone. M told me to borrow money from my friends or family members but I told m that none of them has that kind of money and I don’t have any friends to talk to. Then for some reason, m started to get somewhat aggressive through dm and now, I can’t go back to the beginning of the day. To all the people who are trying to invest for the first time, please do your research and buy little on bitcoin.

2022-03-27 05:07:32,"The Bitcoin Paradox I love Bitcoin ever since hearing about it.

I love it because it is freedom and liberty.

But there is as I see it a paradox emerging- or more like a contest.

Nation states have derived huge power via fiat money- they along with banks can issue fiat to fund wars or projects to buy votes or gain power.  The USA has enjoyed the greatest fiat monetary power being the world reserve currency since Bretton Woods. The vast wealth that being global reserve currency issuer givces the USA has enabled it to maintain global power and dominance but that dominance is waning and US debt is massive- probably impossible to repay. Now China is seeking to challenge that power and dominance. China is building Belt and Road and China is seeking to make the Digital Yuan the new global currency. Saudi Arabia is now considering selling oil for Yuan. Russias invasion on Ukraine is a declaration of war upon the current USA/Europe power.

China has banned Bitcoin and will expect its allies to use Yuan. While USA and Europe still allow BTC. In fact most countries to have banned BTC are autocratic undemocratic and corrupt. Because BTC respects and empowers the individual at the expense of state power.

So the paradox is - does BTC adoption potentially undermine the USD and western liberal democracy and enable Chinese Autocracy to gain global domination?

This is the unsure aspect- perhaps nobody wants Chinese money and the lack of transparency that goes with it.

Or will USA Europe ban BTC if they feel it is allowing value to drain from their fiat hegemony while they are also being challenged by a rising China?

Just my thoughts maybe Ive got it all wrong?",-0.9983144998550415,0.10278787878787882,0.4821818181818182,0.158,0.128,0.714,0.9014

2022-03-28 00:23:05,"I'm Zack, the CEO of Bold, a new credit card collateralized by bitcoin - AMA! Hi [r/Bitcoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/)! I wanted to take a minute to announce Bold, the Bitcoin Credit Card, and introduce myself to you all. We will be launching the product this year.

The idea is Bold will let you:

* Spend on a revolving USD line of credit collateralized by your bitcoin
* Avoid triggering capital gains tax
* Earn bitcoin rewards

This way you can spend dollars while you HODL.

The concept is that Bold is better than traditional credit cards because its limits are higher, rates are lower, payment terms are better, and rewards are in sats. It’s also better than bitcoin loans, because you only pay interest if you carry a balance, rather than borrowing a lump sum and paying interest on all of it starting day 1.

You unlock these benefits by posting some bitcoin as collateral.

We \*never\* rehypothecate your bitcoin collateral.

The collateral is held in a 2-of-4 multisig. You hold one key, Bold holds one key, Bold's capital partner holds one key, and there's a fourth 'safety' key held by a neutral arbitrator we hope never to touch.

Bold is a bitcoin only company. No alts.

We got some coverage in Bitcoin Magazine: [https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bold-credit-card-spend-against-bitcoin-collateral](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bold-credit-card-spend-against-bitcoin-collateral)

If you're interested, you can join our waitlist at [getbold.io](https://getbold.io/).

We will be launching in the US first, followed by North America and Europe, then global.

About me: I've been a bitcoiner since the days of the Magic Internet Money Wizard, ridden the ups and downs since 2014. Bold is the credit card I've wanted for my own use. I hope you all like it too.

AMA!

This is a little project i am working on. I purchased $100 worth of gold and $100 worth of Bitcoin on March 15th 2022 and I plan to track the data until myself or bitcoin is dead. I personally believe bitcoin will be around long after i'm dead. The gold nugget is 1.61 grams and is equal to $100 as of March 15th, 2022 as well as the purchase of 240,313 satoshis also equal to $100. I then transferred the sats to an opendime that I initialized using a photo of myself holding pictures of Jerome Powell and Peter Schiff to generate the wallet address. The transaction confirmed in block 727525 ([link](https://opendime.com/balance/1MdqD1fwhxAfrp6VEv7duNhvSsvJtXyQuc)). 

I have some basic experience with framing and tried my hand at my own shadow box to float everything in. I found someone on etsy to carve me a trophy plaque for $7 and put everything together. The gold and opendime are mounted and floated on the heads of brad nails and mounted with a small bead of hot glue for each. They are secure enough to just sit on a desk or hang but not damage the items. I then pushed the nails through a piece of foam core that I mounted black felt to and added the plaque below with double stick tape.

I plan on tracking the data in google sheets and having a simple line graph mapping out the data points taken on the 15th of each month. I have a Twitter profile that i will use to post the data as this project goes on. follow me at:  @ 100dollarsworth

Currently, with a coupon on ""Consumer Queen,"" you can get a small 1-topping Papa John's Pizza for $4.

This means that, if you had a LOT of those coupons and 1 BTC, at today's rounded price of $47,000 per coin, you could purchase well over 10,000 Papa John's pizzas. 11,750 to be exact.

I understand that the Bitcoin network prevents denial of service attacks by making sure each transaction has a transaction fee. This makes it financially unviable for a node to flood the network with transactions and also provides incentives for miners to process a transaction. But if a node is able send a transaction without any ownership of Bitcoin (0 BTC) by convincing his local client that he has some, how does that stop a peer from receiving that faulty transaction with no transaction fee without receiving anything from it? Wouldn't a peer be able to flood the network with free transaction submissions?

On Friday, a virtual panel made up of Yale’s Gary Gorton, Bank for International Settlements (BIS) executive Hyun Song Shin, and the Fed’s Christopher Waller discussed blockchain technology and CBDCs at great length. The hour-long panel discussion was called “Should Central Bank Issue Digital Currencies?” and Waller is very skeptical about such technologies.

Well, I think you will be pleased to know that crypto is not the current thing, and that’s truly here to stay. 

For starters, crypto was pretty big before all this hype too. Let’s not forget how popular Bitcoin is, and how many cycles of growth and fall it has already gone through, as far as I’m concerned, it has already withstood the test of time and will keep on going further. 

And with every bullish move up it has brought with it a new selection of tokens into the market, litecoin, xrp, Monero, and even eth itself all had their start like this and look at where they are now. 

Bitcoin will not fade away because it’s already a major part of the global chain. I don’t know if many people realize this is or not, but crypto is already integrated into a lot of people’s lives, work and even corporations, if that doesn’t show signs of prevailing I don’t know what will. Many have not only come to include it partly in their life, but make it the center that their lives revolve around. 

Bitcoin is not a trendy fashion it solves a lot of issues that desperately need solving. Notice how crypto is most popular where it is needed not where it is desired merely. Crypto is not a fashion statement, it’s here to solve issues and fix our faulty financial instituition.

Web 3.0 will tokenize everything, making crypto integral to our lives. Let’s not forget that the web 3.0 movement is on the rise, and within it the ecosystem of Theta, or BTT or Aloha defi all are growing rapidly not just in popularity but also in market caps. It’s obvious the world recognizes this move and accepts it.

To my knowledge, bitcoin is hardcapped, meaning there is only going to be a fixed amount of currency.

Also, bitcoin is used by people. People throw away cold wallets. People forget keys. People die.

Bitcoin from those people are irretrievable.

So, inevitably, bitcoin will be forgotten on dead wallets.

The bigger the bitcoin usage, the bigger it's value. The bigger it's value, the bigger an influence lost bitcoin will have.

2022-03-29 10:13:36,"Has the 2022 Bitcoin uptrend begun? Bitcoin continues to trade in correlation with risk assets, specifically the NASDAQ, essentially acting like a leveraged bet on tech. So, it was unsurprising to see it trade above $48,000 for the first time on Monday following a stock market rebound led by tech. 

The recent rally has also been fuelled by the possibility of Russia accepting BTC as payment for oil/gas, and further development on this front would help Bitcoin continue to establish itself in the eye of mainstream investors. If global sentiment also continues to improve, Bitcoin could easily extend its gains alongside other risk assets, although it would likely need to convincingly break its 200-day MA before targeting a retest of the December highs at $52,000.

However, the prospect of more aggressive interest rate hiking cycles, as well as further breakdowns in relations between Russia and The West still pose a threat to investor’s risk appetite. It is therefore important to remember all trading carries risk, as shorts could see Bitcoin hovering near the key 200-day MA as a solid entry point on speculation of a return to risk-adverse trading.",-0.9894077777862549,0.12107843137254903,0.4700980392156863,0.158,0.063,0.778,0.9476

With a local tokenized currency on BTC there can be a fair FIAT system to establish a competition for people and wealth.
If a person wants to live in a other country permanently it only has to change the currency and the old country must send 10ksat to the new country.

2022-03-29 20:30:58,"Hey Greenpeace: Here is how you make Bitcoin green and incentivize renewable energy production at the same time Here is what you do:

1. You seek out locations of stranded waste energy. This is **energy that can not be utilized or stored** because there are no consumers. You typically find this with renewable energy plants because they produce when the wind blows or the sun shines and not when the customer turns on the microwave.
2. You start mining Bitcoin with that energy

This will do two things:

1. It will take away profits from miners who use fossil fuels to mine, because there is a finite amount of coins to be mined in a given time (\~900 BTC per day at the moment). You will start to push them out of the market and make Bitcoin greener
2. At the same time you will make the power plant more profitable, because without someone consuming their energy they would have to stop their production. More profit means they can faster expand their operation and build out more renewable energy plants.

Bonus points:

* Reach out to the companies that build renewable and get your miners on site so they can rake in profits while building the plant, before they are even on the grid.
* Realize that this is already happening and your stupid campaign works directly against the goals of your organization. You fell for the FUD campaign of a shitcoiner or a central banker who is currently crapping their pants because they can't finance their wars without the power to print money.

Just in case this was lost on you, this will actually be profitable. Everyone can do this, there is no excuse not to do it unless you are just talking and don't actually want to take action saving the climate.

A word to the ""but hurr durr, climate change is a hoax""-people:

This works no matter if you believe in climate change or not. Do you think there will be oil forever? You will be glad we have enough electricity, sourced in a decentralized fashion like this if the oil runs out or gets too expensive.

Here are some more details about all of this:

2022-03-30 19:27:01,"War never changes... but Bitcoin levels the battlefield. Make no mistake, Bitcoin is a direct threat to the Ruler's ability to control the world’s money. “E-Cash”/CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency) is coming. The next war the Rulers wage won’t be against countries who challenge their control over the Petrodollar. The war will be against Bitcoin. The main difference between Bitcoin and the system the Ruler is making is it will allow them control over the monetary policies of the system. Bitcoin’s monetary policies can’t be changed or controlled. Bitcoin directly challenges the existing centralized money system. Bitcoin separates money from the Ruler. 

Lots of Traders and Speculators will be sorry when the full force of the War and Media Propaganda Machine comes after the Crypto Industry. Every alt-coin project will likely bend the knee. But, Bitcoin doesn’t have any Master. Bitcoin only knows to continue to enforce its monetary policies by consensus. Bitcoin doesn’t give a fuck. 

It’s unclear if the masses will be wise to the superiority of Bitcoin over a centralized monetary system. It’s unclear if the masses prefer a Big Daddy State vs having sovereignty over their ability to choose how to pursue one's life, liberty and happiness. The choice is clear for me for I have Enormous Kraken Balls. I choose self-sovereignty. What will You choose?

Attacks can come from governments banning/restricting on/off ramps to the block-chain ([https://twitter.com/paddi\_hansen/status/1508895711655612426](https://twitter.com/paddi_hansen/status/1508895711655612426) check this thread about the upcoming EU vote on Thursday, that has an impact on self-hosted wallets);

or from governments banning mining due to the significant energy use it requires (just to break ""our info bubble"" a bit, take a few minutes to read the comments on this [ArsTechnica article](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/03/bitcoins-massive-energy-use-faces-5m-shame-campaign-from-environmental-groups/?comments=1&amp;start=120)).

Sure, banks and governments will fight tooth and nail against something they can't control, but Bitcoin is already a store of value, the block-chain is already more transparent than off-shore financing or cash. Bitcoin is an elegant idea, and block-chain users will probably find a way to adapt to the ever shifting economical and political shape of the world. 

But it won't be easy. Attacks will keep coming. Bitcoin energy use is significant, there is no way around it, and the majority of people still associate it with a get rich quick scheme. The only way for Bitcoin to be successful long term, is a change in public perception. 

A secure, decentralized, p2p economic network, that also act as a store of value, is worth consuming energy for. We just need to get that message out as much as possible.",-0.9933017492294312,0.2617283950617284,0.5727366255144032,0.164,0.053,0.782,0.9833
